      <description>Xubuntu 18.04 “Bionic Beaver” is just around the corner. The first beta milestone arrives next week, and the final release is a little over a month away. 18.04 is an LTS release, meaning it has a 3-year support cycle and is definitely recommended for all users. Or it would be, if we knew it was ready. Stick around&amp;hellip; this is a bit of a long read, but it’s important.&#xA;The ISO Tracker has seen little activity for the last few development cycles.</description>

      <description>Up until the start of the 17.04 cycle the Xubuntu Quality Assurance team had been led by one person. During the last cycle, a break was needed by that person. The recent addition of Dave Pearson to the team meant we were in a position to call on someone else to lead the team.&#xA;Today, we&amp;rsquo;re pleased to announce that Dave will be carrying on as a team lead. However, starting with the artfully named Artful Aardvark cycle, we will migrate to a Quality Assurance team with two leads who will be sharing duties during development cycles.</description>

      <description>Status tracking is useful for all kinds of projects, including Xubuntu. Amongst other things, it allows contributors to quickly see what&amp;rsquo;s left to do and what others are working on. When the tracking data is kept up to date, the resulting data can be immensely helpful.&#xA;Until 2015, the Xubuntu team had been using the common status tracker for Ubuntu teams. For a reason or another, it suddenly stopped working as tracking data from Launchpad didn&amp;rsquo;t make it into the tracker database.</description>

      <description>The Xubuntu documentation, shipped with every release of Xubuntu, is in fact a package that can be built locally, on your computer.&#xA;By default, Xubuntu does not come with the tools required to build the documentation package, so there is the need to prepare your system to be able to do it, by installing the required prerequisite packages. To do this, run the following command:&#xA;sudo apt-get build-dep xubuntu-docs&#xA;Additionally, if you are running a release earlier than 15.</description>

      <description>The Document Foundation http://www.documentfoundation.org&#xA;Many users or members of the community will know this already, but just for the sake of clarity: Xubuntu 15.10 Wily Werewolf will be the first release to ship LibreOffice by default. This has been a long-standing and often-repeated request so we decided to try and evaluate this on our way to the next LTS release, which will be 16.04.&#xA;Consequently, we started evaluating LibreOffice&amp;rsquo;s integration in our Desktop Environment.</description>

      <description>Xubuntu core is a slimmed down version of Xubuntu that doesn’t come with all the additional features of a full and modern desktop. We essentially only ship Xfce and the basic look and feel of Xubuntu, so there will be no office suite, media players, et cetera.&#xA;The obvious benefit is that this ISO (about 600MB) will be faster to download – especially interesting for those with limited connectivity – and fit on a CD.</description>

      <description>Manual testing of the development version is an important part of the development cycle. The goal of manual testing is to find bugs that have been introduced during the cycle.&#xA;Finding these gives developers the opportunity to fix issues before the release. The sooner they are found, the bigger the possibility is that the bugs are fixed before regular users see them on their desktop. Without manual testers, our releases would be buggy.</description>

      <description>The first point release of 14.04 just came out a few days ago and many LTS users waited for this to upgrade from 12.04 – in fact do-release-upgrade only offers the LTS to LTS upgrade after the first point release for stability reasons. So we thought this would be the perfect time to do a quick writeup of a few things to do after upgrading your system. User configuration isn&amp;rsquo;t updated and installed applications aren&amp;rsquo;t removed when upgrading and that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing: Upgraders will not have to restore their customizations and their system will mostly look as before.</description>

      <title>Screen locking in Xubuntu 14.04</title>

      <description>Improving screenlocking (or: sessionlocking) has been on our agenda for a few cycles now. We&amp;rsquo;ve used the old and proven XScreensaver for a few releases, but people have always complained about its antiquated looks (which are also not customizable). Switching to gnome-screensaver wasn&amp;rsquo;t an option because of the additional package dependencies. Furthermore, after gnome-screensaver 3.6, locking became more tightly integrated into Gnome-Shell, which is why Ubuntu/Unity kept version 3.6 and has maintained it for a few releases now.</description>

      <description>Now that Trusty is out the door, we thought that the time was right to bring you a recap of what you&amp;rsquo;ve managed to do for Xubuntu during the last cycle and what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to behind the curtain. Those of you who frequent the #xubuntu-devel channel are likely aware of how much the work people testing do is appreciated. The remainder of you perhaps don&amp;rsquo;t, or just assume so.</description>

      <description>The StartUbuntu project seeks to spread Ubuntu to individuals and organizations who are migrating away from Windows XP when support runs out later this year. As one of their initiatives, Pierre van Male created a flyer featuring Ubuntu and Linux Mate (available here, A4 size only). We decided that this would be a great opportunity to create our own variation - with Xubuntu!&#xA;This month Elizabeth Krumbach Joseph and Pasi Lallinaho got to work on text and graphical updates to make this a reality and we&amp;rsquo;re pleased to announce that the flyers have been created and uploaded to SpreadUbuntu.</description>

      <description>While testing the developer versions in any way possible is a great idea, there isn&amp;rsquo;t much benefit in messages telling us Xubuntu works on machine X, or there were no problems with upgrading machine Y.&#xA;Why? It&amp;rsquo;s not measurable.&#xA;The following sections will explain the kind of figures we would like to measure, why those figures are important and will hopefully give you some motivation to start running and and reporting tests.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s again the time to call for more testers – Xubuntu Raring beta 1 is around.&#xA;Why help with testing? Testing is an excellent and easy way to get involved with Xubuntu. It’s a vital part of our release cycle and anyone with a virtual machine (or even better, a spare computer!) can help out with it. When you do testing you will work with most of the people involved in Xubuntu.</description>

      <description>The Xubuntu team had an extra meeting on Monday to discuss and decide a possible move to a bigger ISO size and other important issues for Raring.&#xA;After a thorough discussion, which included the obvious drawback that will no longer fit on a CD and the amount of developer time currently spent keeping the ISO small enough to fit on a CD, the team decided that Xubuntu will have a 1GB ISO by clear vote of 8-0.</description>

All of these resources are linked at the bottom of every page on Xubuntu.org.&#xA;The most exceptional thing about this experience is that not only did three of the four outlets already exist as fan-created sites, all three of these admins where delighted to add a member of the Xubuntu leadership team as an admin and have their page made Official by the project.</description>

      <description>While we&amp;rsquo;ve been using &amp;ldquo;Greybird&amp;rdquo; as our default theme for a few releases now, I&amp;rsquo;ve continuously worked on it. The goal was not only to ensure the quality of the theme in terms of a flawless Xfce4 and Gtk3 performance and extras like supporting Unity or Compiz, but also to visually keep it up-to-date.&#xA;More contrast After having had a tendency to soften colors and contrasts, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to take a (bold?</description>

      <description>1. Is there a way to use folders shared from Windows? Yes, using Gigolo. If you are not able to see the network check if gvfs-backends is installed.&#xA;2. Thunar loads very slowly on first launch, how do I fix that? Unfortunately, this is a known bug. There are two possible solutions:&#xA;Edit the file /usr/share/gvfs/mounts/network.mount (as root) and change AutoMount to false. This disables the Network browsing when Thunar starts up, but still lets you mount network storage such as Samba shares on demand.</description>

      <description>While there are many people who project a competition between Ubuntu and its flavors, I&amp;rsquo;d like to set a (small) sign that this is definitely not the case.&#xA;With respect to our default theme, &amp;ldquo;Greybird&amp;rdquo;, I have been striving to expand the supported window-managers in the last release &amp;ldquo;Oneiric Ocelot, 11.10&amp;rdquo; (metacity, emerald), to give people who want to use Compiz in Xubuntu an easy way to use our default look.</description>

      <description>For quite a while now there has been questions about resizing windows in Xfce, especially with theme with narrow window-borders. Usually people would ask for wider window-borders, but there are several methods of resizing a window and the thin borders in Xubuntu&amp;rsquo;s current default theme Greybird are not as much of a usability issue as some suggest.&#xA;The five methods Method 1: Using the resize grip Resize grips (usually small triangles) are positioned in the bottom right corner of a window, often as part of a statusbar.</description>

      <description>1. I can’t hear a sound. How can I get my sound back? There are many reasons why sound can be lost on a system, most of them if you try to use different audio protocols. The usual way to get sound back is to run sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart.&#xA;If this doesn’t work you can try running sudo alsa force-unload and sudo alsa force-reload.&#xA;Pulseaudio can sometimes cause conflicts with ALSA.</description>

      <description>As one of Xubuntu&amp;rsquo;s artwork contributors and member of the Shimmerproject I would like to take some time now - towards the end of this cycle - and discuss (at least parts of) the design process during the development phase for Natty (11.04). This is planned as a review and in a way (implicitely) a preview: you can see the direction Xubuntu is heading for since Maverick and Natty and hopefully the project will continue this way.</description>

      <description>It is now possible to order free Xubuntu CDs (see the Get Xubuntu-page). These CDs are generously provided free of charge by On-Disk.com as part of their Quick Ship free disc service, providing an alternative to Ubuntu&amp;rsquo;s ShipIt service which does not provide Xubuntu. This means potential users only have to pay shipping costs, avoiding having to download Xubuntu over a slow internet connection.&#xA;This entails an independent third party service, not run by Canonical nor the Xubuntu developers.</description>
