   <p>As one of Xubuntu&rsquo;s artwork contributors and member of the <a href="http://www.shimmerproject.org">Shimmerproject</a> I would like to take some time now - towards the end of this cycle - and discuss (at least parts of) the design process during the development phase for Natty (11.04). This is planned as a <em>review</em> and in a way (implicitely) a <em>preview</em>: you can see the direction Xubuntu is heading for since Maverick and Natty and hopefully the project will continue this way.</p>
<h3 id="looking-back-on-the-previous-release-aka-maverick">Looking back on the previous release (aka Maverick)</h3>
<p>We started out in early November to analyze what had happened during the Maverick cycle and I realized that with a few aspects of that particular cycle I was really unhappy. For one we started out with developing Bluebird (Maverick&rsquo;s new theme, which was designed as a bright pendant to the well-proven Albatross) very late and also other changes (mostly icons) were done at the last minute. Therefore we didn&rsquo;t have time to (<strong>1</strong>) go through sufficient testing and (<strong>2</strong>) gather feedback to evaluate and fine-tune the theme. Other than that the cooperation with the Xubuntu team worked fine, although I think we didn&rsquo;t communicate enough.</p>
<h3 id="evaluating-the-current-cycle-aka-natty">Evaluating the current cycle (aka Natty)</h3>
<p>In Natty we started pretty early, basically shortly after Maverick was released in late October of 2010 and I continuously developed <em>&ldquo;Greybird&rdquo;</em>, which is code-wise and experience-wise based on <em>Bluebird</em>. We got a lot of feedback from the community that suggested that the blue tones were too intense and in general the reactions were polarizing (meaning: some really liked it, other really disliked it). Therefore I decided to take a different approach and start again with <em>less colors</em> (hence the codename &ldquo;Greybird&rdquo;) and see where we would get with that. Charlie (Xubuntu&rsquo;s Project Leader) decided already during Maverick that one focus of Natty development should be accessibility, in my approach for Greybird these <em>two motivations</em> (less colors for daily use, accessibility) played along very nicely. The whole development process was (at least semi-)public from the beginning, the members of the Xubuntu community provided feedback during the community-meetings and as we felt ready we went public and links and screenshots were published and discussed on various blogs.</p>
<p>Other than the <em>gtk-theme</em> we also did a new <em>xfwm4-theme</em> (based on the elementary-theme by the elementary Team) and decided to go for <em>bigger changes with the panels</em>, making use of the new functions we gained from Xfce4.8. There&rsquo;s now the top panel that traditionally shows the menu-button and system-tray, but now it also contains the list of open windows. So basically the functionality of the two panels has been merged into one. I think the <em>gain in vertical screen estate</em> will be appreciated by users of 16:10 or 16:9 resolutions. In the lower edge we decided to auto-hide the launcher panel, the applications we consider most important for a new user are only one click away with that. This panel is easily customizable, to create new launchers simply drag and drop them from either the menu, appfinder or /usr/share/applications in Thunar. Since the compositor is now switched on by default we can make use of the new panel&rsquo;s gorgeous alpha-transparency and the lower launcher-panel looks beautifully semi-transparent.</p>
<p>One more issue that we were able to fix because we started with artwork so early in the cycle is the <em>resize-grips</em>, which are now shown in practically every window. Since most other urgent things were fixed already it was possible for us to focus on that issue and solve it gracefully: we now have a beautiful and accessible resize-grip in Greybird.</p>
<h3 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h3>
<p>As most of you know the UI-freeze is still some time away, so some things are still in the move. I had more plans for Natty than I was (or will be) able to finish in time (some of those plans and ideas developed throughout the cycle though), so I hope we will take the time and improve our project management by one more step: adding a roadmap for Natty+1 shortly after the release in April.</p>
