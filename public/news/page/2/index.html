   <h2 id="time-to-reveal-your-desktop">Time to reveal your desktop!</h2>
<p>The Xubuntu team is proud to announce a recently launched new project to celebrate our community: the <a href="http://xubuntu-showcase.deviantart.com/">Xubuntu Showcase group</a> group on <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/">deviantART</a>!</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-goal-of-this-project">What is the goal of this project?</h3>
<p>The ultimate goal of this project is to have &ldquo;Desktop of the Week&rdquo; gallery on our website. Each week we will choose a single submission among the pool and showcase it in the front page of the official Xubuntu website as well as promote it on all of our social network outlets and let others do the same!</p>
<p>With the showcase we hope to bring light and interest over our beautiful and interesting desktop and convince the non-believers! And remember, all the screenshots are from real, stable systems configured to suit different workflows and usecases, which proves the Xubuntu desktop a truly configurable versatile desktop.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-take-a-screenshot">How do I take a screenshot?</h3>
<p>To take a screenshot you can simply press the corresponding key on your keyboard. On regular keyboards, look for the &ldquo;Print Screen&rdquo; or &ldquo;Prt Sc&rdquo; key, or in modern laptops and special keyboards this key might be under some Function key. Alternatively, you can launch the Xfce Screenshot tool from the Applications menu, under Accessories » Screenshot.</p>
<p>Please note that all screenshots need to follow the submission guidelines, which are listed on the front page of the <a href="http://xubuntu-showcase.deviantart.com/">Xubuntu Showcase group</a>. Once you&rsquo;ve made sure your screenshot follows the guidelines and is to your liking you can proceed to submit it!</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-submit-my-screenshot">How do I submit my screenshot?</h3>
<p>For now, we only accept submissions sent directly to our deviantART group. To get your screenshot in the moderation queue, simply propose your screenshot for the <a href="http://xubuntu-showcase.deviantart.com/">Xubuntu Showcase group</a> in the <a href="http://xubuntu-showcase.deviantart.com/gallery/44567713">&ldquo;Proposed&rdquo; folder</a>.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve submitted your screenshot, our moderators will process it as soon as possible. If the submission adheres to the guidelines, it will be eventually approved and added to the pool of images where we draw the showcased screenshots. If it does not adhere to guidelines, we will reply with rationale.</p>

   </ul>

   <p><em>The Xubuntu team hears stories about how it is used in organizations all over the world. In this &ldquo;Xubuntu at..&rdquo; series of interviews, we seek to interview organizations who wish to share their stories. If your organization is using Xubuntu and you want to share what you&rsquo;re doing with us please contact Elizabeth Krumbach Joseph at <a href="mailto:lyz@ubuntu.com">lyz@ubuntu.com</a> to discuss details about your organization.</em></p>
<p>Jeff Hanson of <em>Project: Community Computers</em> recently contacted the Xubuntu developers to introduce the work his organization is doing and ask about how best to give feedback. We took this opportunity to launch our <em>&ldquo;Xubuntu at&hellip;&rdquo;</em> series of interviews by asking him more about the organization!</p>
<p><strong>Please tell us a bit about yourself and Project: Community Computers.</strong></p>
<p>Mission Statement: “Project: Community Computers reduces e-waste and bridges the digital divide by reusing and recycling computers and bringing technology access to those in need.”</p>
<p>We started as a student group at the Milwaukee School of Engineering in 2009. Our mission is to kill two birds with one stone. Millions of tons of working computer hardware are thrown away every year, and billions of people around the world are with extremely limited access to technology. If you think about all that having a computer and Internet access opens up for you in the 21st Century, you’d have to wonder how people without it ever compete. No doing your homework when you go home from school. No using it to search and apply for jobs. No using it the unlimited resources to expand your knowledge and skill sets. We aim to give people a critical tool to break the cycle of poverty.</p>
<p>This isn’t even a developing world problem, there are almost 30 million people in the United States alone that don’t have a computer at home. We aim to redirect computers from the landfill to people that use them around the world. We’ve set up public computer labs at schools, community centers, and churches in Kenya, Cameroon, Mexico, and China, just to name a few places, in addition to our growing body of work in inner city Milwaukee.</p>
<p><img src="Project_CC_2.jpg" alt="" title="Project_CC_2"></p>
<p>After being a student group for so many years, we’re currently working on turning Project:CC into an independent 501c(3) to expand and sustain our mission.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.projectcc.org/?page_id=409">Read more about Project: Community Computers</a></p>
<p><strong>What influenced your decision to use Open Source software in your organization?</strong></p>
<p>There are both practical and ideological reasons for using open source software. Putting open source software on donated hardware allows us to give technology access to the people that need it for free. All we have to add are tech skills and time. Furthermore, what the open source movement is trying to do with software is the exact same idea as what we are trying to do with technology access: Democratization, equal access, and equal opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>What made you select Xubuntu for your deployments?</strong></p>
<p>It’s no secret that Ubuntu is one of the most user-friendly Linux distributions, if not operating systems, around, so using Ubuntu was a no-brainer for us, especially since many of our users have had very limited access to and experience with computers. This is not even to speak of stability and security inherent with Linux.</p>
<p>Since we use a lot of donated, older hardware, Xubuntu&rsquo;s lightweight Xfce environment makes it so even 10 year old hardware runs smoothly. Occasionally, we’ll get some hardware so old that even Xubuntu won’t run and we have to recycle it, but Xubuntu allows us to get more donated hardware into the hands of people who need it.</p>
<p><img src="Project_CC_1.jpg" alt="" title="Project_CC_1"></p>
<p><strong>Can you tell us a bit about your Xubuntu setup?</strong></p>
<p>We start with the current Xubuntu LTS, and then we add all four Edubuntu packs from the software center. So you have all the educational content of Edubuntu with the lightweight stable interface of Xubuntu.</p>
<p>Recently we decided to add LibreOffice and remove Abiword and Gnumeric. I really enjoyed the simplicity of these two programs, however they were lacking some compatibility and the switch really came when we needed a presentation program and decided we should just move all productivity software to Libre to keep things as easy for our users as possible.</p>
<p>A few other programs are added as well such as Celestia, Xaos, Skype, Dropbox, and we continue to keep an eye out for good programs.</p>
<p>The rest is just little settings, like having the system autologin (so users in the lab don’t ever need a password unless changing settings.), frequency of getting updates, sending feedback, power settings, etc.</p>
<p>We do the whole install on something small like an 8gig flash drive and create the image off of this. Then we can throw the image on any usb drive or hard drive 8 gigs or more.</p>
<p>Imaging becomes overly simple by using Ubuntu because there really are no proprietary drivers. We have one image. The image can be put on any type of hard drive and into any computer and it will boot the same. (Just another example of how Ubuntu allows our project to work so effectively )</p>
<p>For us to image a drive it takes between 7 and 10 minutes depending on the connection. This means if we have a laptop donated for example, and say windows wasn&rsquo;t booting properly, or it had a virus, it’s a matter of removing the hard drive, waiting 10 minutes for it to image, putting it back in and booting it up!</p>
<p>We use USB to Hard Drive adapters so we can image from a laptop to any type of drive. Many times around Milwaukee, we’ll be setting up a lab and they might already have computers that are just running slowly, so we’ll show up with a laptop and image the computers on site to save everyone time and keep reusing the same computers.</p>
<p>We are currently looking for a new open source solution for imaging drives, that includes allowing someone running a lab to easily reimage a computer without removing the hard drive or crawling through too many text based screens. We’d greatly appreciate any feedback on this matter.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.projectcc.org/?page_id=1267">Read more about their deployment.</a></p>
<p><img src="Project_CC_3.jpg" alt="" title="Project_CC_3"></p>
<p><strong>Is there anything else you wish to share with us about your organization or how you use Xubuntu?</strong></p>
<p>Thank you to everybody who has contributed to the development and creation of Xubuntu, we really appreciate it and love using it! Your work is having a real impact, both on the environment and the lives of people in need.</p>
<p>If you’d like to contribute either hardware or money, we’re happily accepting both. We’re planning trips to Sierra Leone and Jamaica later this year, so we need all of the computers we can get! Currently, we are raising funds to move out of our small student org office space that MSOE has graciously given us and into a bigger space. <a href="http://www.projectcc.org/?page_id=1055">Details on how to donate can be found at our website.</a></p>
<p>If you think this is a great idea and you’d love to do it in your town, please contact us, we’d love to help you get started!</p>

   </ul>

   <p>After three Nights of Xubuntu, the Xubuntu team is able to present you a quick overview of some of the planned features and improvements for Xubuntu 13.10. Enjoy!</p>
<h2 id="software-and-development">Software and development</h2>
<p>On the software side, <a href="http://apt-offline.alioth.debian.org/">apt-offline</a> will be included in our default installation after a few cycles of preparing and writing documentation for it. This will help our users who have impaired-bandwidth situations and usage documentation is already present in the 13.04 offline documentation. The team is also considering the possibility to add a <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Roadmap/Specifications/Quantal/KeyboardShortcutsOverlay">keyboard shortcuts overlay</a> to help new (and why not old) users with their shortcuts-fu. Finally, the team is looking to improve the Pavucontrol user interface to make it more intuitive.</p>
<p>The team also discussed if a heads-up display (HUD) would fit to the Xubuntu paradigm and if it would be viable to implement. The team decided that including or working with one should be postponed until after the long-term support (LTS) release since there isn’t a proof of concept of a HUD suitable for Xubuntu ready and developing one would take a lot of developer time. Further inquiry can take place, though.</p>
<p>Besides the additions and improvements to software, the team roughly discussed including a Xubuntu core meta package which would include only a basic system without various applications seen in the current default installation. Some team members are working on drafts for the contents for the package as you read this article. The meta package would be installable instead of the Xubuntu desktop package during installation.</p>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>The team is keeping the pressure up on the documentation improvements. The team is looking to extend the re-written Xubuntu documentation from a few releases ago even further as well as to get the infrastructure rights to enable translations for the documentation.</p>
<p>In addition, another goal is to get started with the 12.04 documentation review to supply a more up-to-date version via a stable release update for the LTS users as well.</p>
<h2 id="community">Community</h2>
<p>As with the previous cycles, we will keep on focusing on community. One of our targets this cycle is to get several people new upload rights to the Xubuntu package set. We also hope the prospective developers can help create processes with the <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/xubuntu-devel/2013-May/008881.html">newly appointed QA team lead</a> to help reinforce the QA team as well as help with their testing duties.</p>
<h2 id="milestone-participation">Milestone participation</h2>
<p>As usually, Xubuntu is following the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SaucySalamander/ReleaseSchedule" title="Ubuntu release schedule for Saucy Salamander">Ubuntu release schedule</a>. While the release schedule is far from final, the Xubuntu team is planning to release one alpha and both betas. At the moment the alpha participation looks pretty certain but the details depend on the Xfce 4.12 release. We will keep sending updates as soon as we have any news.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In the end, this is a final tune-up before we head into developing the LTS release that is expected to be unleashed in April 2014. Xubuntu presents a conservative desktop choice among the Ubuntu flavours. As we head into the Saucy Salamander development cycle, we will be striving for excellence once more.</p>

   <p>Due to the size of the Xubuntu ISOs starting from Raring (13.04), they no longer fit on a standard CD. This guide will help you if your BIOS doesn&rsquo;t support booting off of USB drives by showing you how to use <a href="http://www.plop.at/">Plop</a> boot manager.</p>
<h3 id="getting-plop">Getting Plop</h3>
<p>You can download the most recent version <a href="http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanager/download.html">here</a> (plpbt-*).</p>
<h3 id="executing-plop">Executing Plop</h3>
<p>The burning process is similar as documented on the <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto">Ubuntu wiki</a>.</p>
<p>Main contents of the downloaded archive should be:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>1README.TXT  Instructional Readme.
plpbt.bin    Boot manager binary
plpbt.img    Boot manager floppy disk image
plpbt.iso    Boot manager CD ISO
plpbtrom.bin Boot manager ROM file for the BIOS

doc/          Documentation
experimental/ Experimental versions
pcmcia/       PCMCIA version of the boot manager
Linux/        Linux related programs
Windows/      Windows related programs
</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>You will then have to create your bootable USB device (flash drive) as documented in the <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick">installation section</a> of the Ubuntu wiki.</p>
<p>After you create both the bootable USB device and Plop CD, place the CD in the CD drive, and power off the computer. After you power off, place the USB device in the computer and turn the computer on, you may need to go into the BIOS settings and configure it to boot from CD first.</p>

        <img src="http://localhost:1313/news/2013/booting-the-xubuntu-usb-image-from-a-cd/plop-menu.png"/> </figure>

<p>After you boot into Plop from the CD, you should see a “USB” item on the menu that will appear (as pictured to the right), select it with the Down arrow key, then hit Enter to boot.</p>
<p>If everything has gone as expected, Xubuntu live desktop should boot from USB. Enjoy!</p>

   <p>The Xubuntu team is glad to announce the immediate release of Xubuntu 13.04 Beta 1!</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Starting from 13.04, the Xubuntu images will not fit on standard CDs any more. This affects the Beta 1 images as well. To install Xubuntu, you will need other media such as a USB device or a DVD. The Xubuntu 13.04 Beta 1 image size is approximately 850 MB.</p>
<p>Xubuntu 13.04 is mostly a maintenance release, and there won&rsquo;t be too many new features. New features and bug fixes worth mentioning in Beta 1 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gnumeric and GIMP are reintroduced</li>
<li>New version of Parole (0.5.0) is included</li>
<li>Duplicate partitions are no longer shown on desktop or Thunar</li>

   <p>It&rsquo;s again the time to call for more testers – Xubuntu Raring beta 1 is around.</p>
<h2 id="why-help-with-testing">Why help with testing?</h2>
<p>Testing is an excellent and easy way to get involved with Xubuntu. It’s a vital part of our release cycle and anyone with a virtual machine (or even better, a spare computer!) can help out with it. When you do testing you will work with most of the people involved in Xubuntu. Don&rsquo;t be afraid, we won&rsquo;t bite you!</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-need-to-do">What do I need to do?</h2>
<p>There are different ways of testing the ISOs for all of our releases. Here&rsquo;s a quick overview of the different tests we need to run:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Installation testing</strong> to make sure our ISO&rsquo;s are installable</li>
<li><strong>Live CD testing</strong> to make sure the live CD environment works as expected (and to make sure persistency works on live USB)</li>
<li><strong>Post-installation testing</strong> to make sure our applications work as expected</li>
<li><strong>Upgrade testing</strong> to make sure upgrades from old releases work as expected</li>
</ol>
<p>All the results from different tests are reported and recorded on the <a href="http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu ISO Tracker</a>. You will need a Ubuntu Single Sign-On account to log in and send results.</p>
<p>Finally, to run a test and report it so it helps the Xubuntu team, you need to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu ISO Tracker</a> and Log in</li>
<li>Click <strong>Raring Beta 1</strong> and select your infrastructure from the <strong>Xubuntu</strong> product at the bottom of the page</li>
<li>Download the appropriate ISO (see <strong>Link to download information</strong> at the top of the page for download links as well as zsync commands)</li>
<li>Select a test you want to run – it&rsquo;s best to start with an installation test and then advance to post-installation tests to get the most out of your time</li>
<li>On any test page, you should see the testcase instructions (if you don&rsquo;t, click on <strong>Testcase</strong>) and follow them step by step</li>
<li>If you find bugs while running the test, add them to the report and if they don&rsquo;t exist, <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs">file them</a></li>
<li>In the <strong>Bugs to look for</strong> section you will see bugs that people have been experiencing with the same test before – specifically look out for these</li>
<li>Once you&rsquo;ve finished with the testcase, <strong>report your results</strong>; select the overall <strong>result</strong> for the test and list any <strong>bugs</strong> you experienced during testing. Remember to click <strong>Submit result</strong> when you&rsquo;re done – <em>if you don&rsquo;t do this, the Xubuntu team doesn&rsquo;t get any benefit from the test!</em></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="need-more-information-or-help">Need more information or help?</h2>
<p>All of the different testing areas for Xubuntu follow more or less the same pattern. To get detailed instructions with pictures on how to report test results refer to the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/ISO/Walkthrough">ISO testing Walkthrough on the Ubuntu wiki</a>. You can also ask for help in our developer IRC channel <a href="http://etherpad.ubuntu.com/ep/search?query=xubuntu-devel">#xubuntu-devel</a> on Freenode.</p>
<p>Once you get more into testing, there are ways to make downloading the latest images and testing them easier for you. These include but are not limited to zsyncing new images, using Testdrive to manage your tests, etc&hellip; To read more about the Ubuntu Testing framework and the Ubuntu Quality Assurance team, read the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam">QA Team wiki</a>.</p>

   </ul>

   <p>The Xubuntu team had an extra meeting on Monday to discuss and decide a possible move to a bigger ISO size and other important issues for Raring.</p>
<p>After a thorough discussion, which included the obvious drawback that will no longer fit on a CD and the amount of developer time currently spent keeping the ISO small enough to fit on a CD, the team decided that Xubuntu will have a 1GB ISO by clear vote of 8-0. The bigger ISO size will be featured starting from Raring, which is due to be released in April.</p>
<p>With this extra 300MB of space, the team has decided to reintroduce both Gnumeric spreadsheet application and GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) image editor, both of which were dropped for the 12.10 release due to space constraints. Discussion about reintroduction of more of the most popular language packs and extra artwork will continue on the IRC channel #xubuntu-devel and on the <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/xubuntu-devel">Xubuntu development mailing list</a> in the following weeks. As always, the team will adhere to the tenants of the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/StrategyDocument">Strategy Document</a> when discussing these changes and strive to not add things to the ISO just because space is available.</p>
<p>Full logs and minutes from our meeting are available on our wiki <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Meetings/Archive/Minutes/2013-02-11-isosize">here</a>.</p>

   </ul>

   <p>Welcome! To provide a better experience to all the Xubuntu users we gather what we consider to be common questions any user might come to find.</p>
<p>We have been doing this for the last few releases, check the previous FAQ to find out interesting and probably helpful information about your system.</p>
<p>In this particular release of Xubuntu we have moved out of Xfce 4.8, into the most recent 4.10, this carries some issues when updating that we would like to help you overcome:</p>
<h3 id="1-after-upgrading-to-xubuntu-1210-my-panel-icons-are-all-group-together-to-one-side-of-the-panel-how-do-i-make-them-occupy-the-whole-of-it">1. After upgrading to Xubuntu 12.10 my panel icons are all group together to one side of the panel, how do I make them occupy the whole of it?</h3>
<p>This happens because of some changes on the xfce 4.10 panel structures, you need to <em>add a separator item</em> to the panel and set it to <em>expand</em> to fix this issue.</p>
<h3 id="2-where-did-the-messaging-menu-go">2. Where did the messaging menu go?</h3>
<p>Due to constraints unavoidable by the Xubuntu team the messaging menu is not available in Xubuntu 12.10, you must use Xubuntu 12.04 if you wish to have this menu/indicator.</p>
<h3 id="3-i-dont-see-my-sound-indicator-anymore-how-do-i-get-it-back">3. I don&rsquo;t see my sound indicator anymore, how do I get it back?</h3>
<p>Right-click on a blank area of the panel and select <em>Panel <strong>»</strong> Add New Items&hellip;</em> Find the Indicator Plugin in the list, select it and click the &ldquo;Add&rdquo; button.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Use <em>Panel <strong>»</strong> Panel Preferences&hellip; <strong>»</strong> Items</em> to move it to a location of your preferences.</p>
<h3 id="4-duplicated-partitions-are-shown-in-the-thunar-sidebar-and-the-desktop">4. Duplicated partitions are shown in the Thunar sidebar and the desktop</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, this is a known bug for some users. There is a fix in the -proposed repository, which you may enable in the Software Center and upgrade thunar to the new version.</p>
<p><em>Warning:</em> This archive is &ldquo;proposed&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s now available for testing, it is not yet a fully-tested part of the system and may have packages that are unstable.</p>
<h3 id="5-alternate-images-are-no-longer-available-how-do-i-install-xubuntu-with-the-text-installer">5. Alternate images are no longer available, how do I install Xubuntu with the text installer?</h3>
<p>Use the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Core">ubuntu-core</a> image and choose the selection for installing Xubuntu.</p>
<h3 id="6-when-i-drag-a-window-to-the-upper-border-of-the-screen-it-resizes-to-the-width-of-the-screen-and-half-its-height-how-do-i-prevent-this">6. When I drag a window to the upper border of the screen, it resizes to the width of the screen and half its height, how do I prevent this?</h3>
<p>This is a new feature in Xfce 4.10, which is included in Xubuntu 12.10. To disable this, go into <em>Settings Manager <strong>»</strong> Window Manager Tweaks <strong>»</strong> Accessibility</em> and uncheck &ldquo;Automatically tile windows when moving toward the screen edge&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="7-how-do-i-search-for-proprietary-drivers-available-on-my-system">7. How do I search for proprietary drivers available on my system?</h3>
<p>In order to enable proprietary drivers which are packaged for Xubuntu, you open the Ubuntu Software Center and go to <em>Edit <strong>»</strong> Software Sources <strong>»</strong> Additional Drivers</em>. This will allow you to select which drivers you wish to use.</p>
<h3 id="8-thunar-loads-very-slowly-on-first-launch-how-do-i-fix-that">8. Thunar loads very slowly on first launch, how do I fix that?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, this is a <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/thunar/+bug/775117">known bug</a>. See <a href="http://xubuntu.org/news/faq-1204-precise/">FAQ for Xubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin</a> for more on how to work around this.</p>
<h3 id="9-is-there-a-way-to-use-folders-shared-from-windows">9. Is there a way to use folders shared from Windows?</h3>
<p>Yes, using Gigolo. See <a href="http://xubuntu.org/news/faq-1204-precise/">FAQ for Xubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin</a> for more.</p>

   <p>When you go to &ldquo;Help&rdquo; in the main menu in Xubuntu Firefox will launch and bring you to an offline documentation page where users can learn the basics.</p>
<p>After a couple of cycles without updates, the Xubuntu team worked hard this cycle to take a fresh look at the documentation. The team spent time reorganizing the structure, updating to reflect current default applications and in many cases completely rewriting whole sections. The look was also refreshed to reflect the current style and branding that the project has adopted.</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="http://localhost:1313/news/releases/12.10/offline-documentation-rewritten-for-12-10/xubuntu_docs_1210.png"/> </figure>

<p>The team would like to formally thank the following volunteers who made this effort possible:</p>
<p>Pasi Lallinaho (knome) for leading up the effort in lieu of a formal Documentation Lead this cycle. Pasi also contributed directly to the documentation itself, tracked reviews, updated documentation branding, converted everything back into DocBook and worked with the Ubuntu Doc team to get the documentation uploaded and released before the documentation freeze.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Krumbach (lyz) for setting up, hosting and maintaining the wiki that was used by the team during the rewrite and coordinating some of the work between volunteers and the Ubuntu Doc team.</p>
<p>Sean Davis (smd-seandavis), Jack Fromm (jjfrv8-gmail), Kev (elfy) and Jay van Cooten (skippersboss) for their extensive edits both the writing of the documentation and efforts during the rushed review process.</p>
<h2 id="but-thats-not-all">But that&rsquo;s not all&hellip;</h2>
<p>The work of a documentation writer is never truly finished! The team has already defined several areas where we&rsquo;d like to improve upon the documentation for the 13.04 cycle, including: improvements to packaging, translations support, routine documentation review and expanding some of the shorter sections.</p>
<p>To see the complete and current list of things we are planning to improve even further, see <a href="https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/other-r-xubuntu-docs">our documentation blueprint for the R cycle</a>. If you want to help us with the planning, want to take part in the discussion or want to get your hands dirty when it&rsquo;s time to work again, subscribe to the blueprint, apply to the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~xubuntu-doc">xubuntu-doc Launchpad team</a> and be in touch with us (see the <a href="http://xubuntu.org/contribute/">starting points at Get Involved</a>)!</p>

   <p>The Xubuntu team is proud to announce the Alpha3 release of Xubuntu 12.10, Quantal Quetzal!</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have any major changes from the Alpha2, but there are a few known issues you should be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are no alternate images for this release</li>

   <p>In the past year the Xubuntu project has gone from zero to four social media outlets for sharing our project updates, news and discussions. All of these resources are linked at the bottom of every page on Xubuntu.org.</p>
<p>The most exceptional thing about this experience is that not only did three of the four outlets <em>already exist</em> as fan-created sites, all three of these admins where delighted to add a member of the Xubuntu leadership team as an admin and have their page made Official by the project. As our intention was to not only reach more users through these resources, but also to involve more people in the project, for each of these resources we&rsquo;ve asked them to keep on running the groups as they used to.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://twitter.com/Xubuntu">Twitter</a></strong></p>
<p>This is the only social media account that we created. Currently project lead Pasi Lallinaho and I work to keep it updated.</p>

         Xubuntu&#39;s default theme gets a refresh for Quantal
      </a>
   </h1>

   </ul>

   <p>While we&rsquo;ve been using &ldquo;Greybird&rdquo; as our default theme for a few releases now, I&rsquo;ve continuously worked on it. The goal was not only to ensure the quality of the theme in terms of a flawless Xfce4 and Gtk3 performance and extras like supporting Unity or Compiz, but also to visually keep it up-to-date.</p>
<h3 id="more-contrast">More contrast</h3>
<p>After having had a tendency to soften colors and contrasts, I&rsquo;ve decided to take a (bold?) step and counter this tendency. This is why the changes for the upcoming Quantal release might seem more drastic then between the releases before. After playing with it for a while, I realized that going this direction half-way wouldn&rsquo;t work well, so while I&rsquo;m aware that there might be quite a bit of whining (partly because people may miss the &ldquo;old Greybird&rdquo;, partly because change always provokes whining) I really hope that many and most of you will fall in love with the changes the way I did while working on it.</p>
<h3 id="built-around-gtk2">Built around Gtk2</h3>
<p>Since the Xfce developer community decided a while ago not to port their (and consequently: our) desktop to Gtk3 in the next release (4.12) and instead to postpone that until performance and memory issues with Gtk3 would be fixed (keeping my fingers crossed), I built the refresh of Greybird around Gtk2. As this will be the main platform for our users&rsquo; desktop experience, I&rsquo;ll try my best to port all the changes to Gtk3 as perfectly as possible, so that hopefully no-one will notice whether an app is Gtk2 or Gtk3 (because I firmly believe that users <em>shouldn&rsquo;t</em> have to care about things like that).</p>
<p>So, without much further ado and blathering, here goes a representational compilation for our Greybird refresh.</p>

   </ul>

   <p>It is the <strong>time to submit your ideas</strong> on how to make Xubuntu better: the brainstorming phase for the 12.10 roadmap is on now! It is also a good <strong>time to start contributing</strong>, since every item needs an assignee – without assignees, even good ideas will not be approved – thus not implemented.</p>
<p>Everybody is welcome to submit ideas to the roadmap brainstorm until the end of week 19 (13th of May). To do this, edit the table in the section <em>New features, major bugs, improvements to community</em> on the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Roadmap/Goals/Quantal">roadmap page for Quantal</a>. Please add new ideas to the end of the table so it is easier to follow submissions.</p>
<p>If you are willing to <strong>implement a feature</strong> too (or work on an item when &ldquo;implementing&rdquo; is not applicable), you can add yourself to the assignee field on any item with no assignee, including your own submission. Please note that the default application specifications will need assignees as well. Feel free to add yourself as an assignee to any of these too, even if they had an assignee already – multiple assignees will most probably lead to better objectivity.</p>
<p>If you set yourself as assignee to any item and are not an active member in the Xubuntu community, please send an email to the <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/xubuntu-devel">Xubuntu development mailing list</a> to introduce yourself quickly. Unless we hear from assignees before the end of week 20 (20th of May), ideas will not be approved anyway. Approving will happen during week 20 by the Xubuntu team.</p>

         <li>faq</li>
      
   </ul>

   <h3 id="1-is-there-a-way-to-use-folders-shared-from-windows">1. Is there a way to use folders shared from Windows?</h3>
<p>Yes, using Gigolo. If you are not able to see the network check if <code>gvfs-backends</code> is installed.</p>
<h3 id="2-thunar-loads-very-slowly-on-first-launch-how-do-i-fix-that">2. Thunar loads very slowly on first launch, how do I fix that?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, this is a <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/thunar/+bug/775117">known bug</a>. There are two possible solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit the file <code>/usr/share/gvfs/mounts/network.mount</code> (as root) and change <code>AutoMount</code> to <code>false</code>. This disables the Network browsing when Thunar starts up, but still lets you mount network storage such as Samba shares on demand. Please note that this solution leaves you with a broken &ldquo;Network&rdquo; link in Thunar.</li>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t use Samba (Windows shares), remove <code>gvfs-backends</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-i-cant-resize-windows-because-the-window-borders-are-too-tiny">3. I can&rsquo;t resize windows because the window borders are too tiny!</h3>
<p>The suggested way to resize windows is to hold the Alt key, right-click somewhere inside the window and drag to resize. See <a href="http://xubuntu.org/news/window-resizing-in-xubuntu-and-xfce/" title="Window resizing in Xubuntu (and Xfce)">Window resizing in Xubuntu (and Xfce)</a> for all the different methods.</p>
<h3 id="4-is-there-a-way-to-use-dropbox-with-thunar">4. Is there a way to use Dropbox with Thunar?</h3>
<p>There is an unofficial and unsupported <a href="http://softwarebakery.com/maato/thunar-dropbox.html">plugin for Dropbox on Thunar</a>.</p>
<p>To compile the package, you need to install <code>libthunarx-2-dev</code>. In addition, you need to install <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/install?os=lnx">Dropbox</a> as well as start the daemon installation with <code>dropbox start -i</code>. Please note that this will install the propietary Dropbox daemon. Running this command will also start a wizard to set up your Dropbox account, including a possibility to create one.</p>
<h3 id="5-how-do-i-configure-multiple-monitors">5. How do I configure multiple monitors?</h3>
<p>To set up and configure multiple monitors and/or other output devices you can use arandr, which is a simple drag-and-drop front-end for xrandr.</p>
<p>If you are using the propietary Nvidia driver, you can use the <code>nvidia-settings</code> tool.</p>
<h3 id="6-installing-package-x-installs-a-lot-of-other-packages">6. Installing package X installs a lot of other packages!</h3>
<p>There is a way to stop installing the so-called &ldquo;recommends&rdquo; packages automatically. For single packages, you should use the <code>--no-install-recommends</code> switch with <code>apt-get</code>. To turn off installing recommends for all packages, do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Synaptic, go to Settings <strong>»</strong> Preferences <strong>»</strong> tab General and uncheck &ldquo;Consider recommended packages as dependencies&rdquo;</li>
<li>Create the file <code>/usr/apt/apt.conf.d/05norecommends</code> and add the following line in the file: <code>APT::Install-Recommends &quot;false&quot;;</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-how-do-i-disable-guest-login-how-do-i-enable-autologin">7. How do I disable guest login? How do I enable autologin?</h3>
<p>Edit the file <code>/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf;</code></p>
<ul>
<li>To disable guest login, set <code>allow-guest</code> to <code>false</code></li>
<li>To enable autologin, edit the file to look like this: [SeatDefaults] autologin-user=&lt;USERNAME&gt; autologin-user-timeout=0 user-session=xubuntu greeter-session=lightdm-gtk-greeter</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-how-can-i-edit-the-applications-menu">8. How can I edit the applications menu?</h3>
<p>Xubuntu 12.04 has the Alacarte menu editor installed by default. You can launch it from Applications menu <strong>»</strong> Settings <strong>»</strong> Main menu.</p>
<h3 id="9-my-theme-shows-white-text-on-light-background-help">9. My theme shows white text on light background. Help!</h3>
<p>You are most probably using the <a href="http://shimmerproject.org/project/albatross/">Albatross</a> theme. Unfortunately, this theme is not updated yet to fully support GTK3. There is a bug about this (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/shimmer-themes/+bug/989814">LP #989814</a>) with an attached patch which provides a quick workaround, too.</p>
<p>For the best GTK3 support, we advise to use the <a href="http://shimmerproject.org/project/greybird/">Greybird</a> theme, which is the default for Xubuntu 12.04.</p>
<h2 id="still-having-issues">Still having issues?</h2>
<p>Please see the earlier <a href="http://xubuntu.org/news/category/faq/">FAQ articles</a> on our website. While some of the questions are release-specific, most of them are still applicable to 12.04. Topics include changing and installing themes, Compiz on Xubuntu and much more. If you are still having issues, refer to the <a href="http://xubuntu.org/help/">Help &amp; Support section</a> for a list of available support methods.</p>

<p>In addition, you can stick a window (making it appear in all workspaces) with <strong>Alt F8</strong>.

<h3 id="problems-with-keyboard-shortcuts-after-upgrading">Problems with keyboard shortcuts after upgrading</h3>
<p>There is a change in how the shortcuts are handled, which will render all shortcuts with the <em>Control</em> key ususable on upgrade. To fix this, you need to update all your current shortcuts with Control: In Settings Manager » Keyboard » tab Application shortcuts, double click on the Shortcut column where it reads <code>&lt;Control&gt;</code> and press the (same) key combination. This will change the part <code>&lt;Control&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;Primary&gt;</code> and the shortcut will work again. The other option is to revert the keyboard shortcut settings back to defaults and readd your custom shortcuts.</p>

<p>With respect to our default theme, &ldquo;Greybird&rdquo;, I have been striving to expand the supported window-managers in the last release &ldquo;Oneiric Ocelot, 11.10&rdquo; (metacity, emerald), to give people who want to use Compiz in Xubuntu an easy way to use our default look.</p>
<p>So for this cycle (&ldquo;Precise Pangolin&rdquo;) I started working on adding <em>support for Unity in Greybird</em>. Unfortunately there were so many things to do in the artwork-department during this cycle that I could only start a very short while ago, so we&rsquo;re far past the freezes. So far our testers report that things are working well and if there are no blockers coming up, this will hopefully land in Precise via the -proposed repository.</p>
<h3 id="try-for-yourself">Try for yourself!</h3>
<p>You can try this version of Greybird even before it lands in any repository very easily by <a href="https://github.com/shimmerproject/Greybird/tarball/v0.8.1" title="Greybird 0.8.1 via Github">downloading the 0.8.1 release</a> and unpacking the theme into ~/.themes (if that directory doesn&rsquo;t exist, simply create it).</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is currently no built-in way of switching to any other than the short list of themes that Ubuntu ships by default in Unity, so those of you who want to give this a try will have to use something like &ldquo;GNOME Tweak Tool&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ubuntu Tweak&rdquo; or &ldquo;My Unity&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If you find any bugs please <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/shimmer-themes/+bugs" title="File a bug on launchpad against Greybird">file them on launchpad</a>! Thanks in advance and happy testing!</p>
<h3 id="a-few-screenshots">A few screenshots</h3>
<p>And finally, since everyone loves screenshots, here go a few of Unity with Greybird in action, taken by our tester Carlos.</p>

         Window resizing in Xubuntu (and Xfce)

         <li>faq</li>
      
   </ul>

   <p>For quite a while now there has been questions about resizing windows in Xfce, especially with theme with narrow window-borders. Usually people would ask for wider window-borders, but there are several methods of resizing a window and the thin borders in Xubuntu&rsquo;s current default theme Greybird are not as much of a usability issue as some suggest.</p>
<h2 id="the-five-methods">The five methods</h2>
<h3 id="method-1-using-the-resize-grip">Method 1: Using the resize grip</h3>
<p>Resize grips (usually small triangles) are positioned in the bottom right corner of a window, often as part of a statusbar. Before 12.04 (Precise Pangolin), Ubuntu had patched Gtk2 to add these resize grips to <em>all</em> applications. This would allow people to easily grab each window and resize it, even with theme with thin borders.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this patch had some regressions; for example, clicking OpenOffice&rsquo;s resize grip would open the file menu. The regressions made Ubuntu developers drop the feature from 12.04. Starting from 12.04, Gtk2 applications will have to use one of the other resizing methods for applications that don&rsquo;t have a built-in resize grip. All the Gtk3 applications will have a resize grip in Greybird (Xubuntu&rsquo;s default theme).</p>
<h3 id="method-2-alt--right-click--drag">Method 2: Alt + right-click + drag</h3>
<p>This is maybe the easiest and most useful way of resizing windows. I&rsquo;m tempted to say that once you got accustomed to this it&rsquo;s hard to go back. Simply hold the Alt key, right-click somewhere inside the window and drag to resize. It works intriguingly well and is a very nice complement to the easiest way of moving windows: holding Alt and left-click drag.</p>
<h3 id="method-3-keyboard-shortcut">Method 3: Keyboard shortcut</h3>
<p>Xfwm4, Xfce&rsquo;s window manager, supports a number of keyboard shortcuts (which can be edited by going to the Settings Manager &gt; Window Manager &gt; Keyboard). One of them is for resizing windows with your keyboard. There is currently no keyboard shortcut set by default, but you can set one in the Window Manager dialog.</p>
<p>As soon as your keyboard-shortcut (in Xfce upstream its Alt+F8) is hit, you can then resize the window by either moving your mouse (no need to click or drag) or use your keyboard arrow keys.</p>
<h3 id="method-4-using-the-top-corners-of-a-window">Method 4: Using the top corners of a window</h3>
<p>While the resize grip has been removed from Gtk2 in Ubuntu and isn&rsquo;t present in every application, you can always resize windows by using the two top corners with the mouse. In most Xfwm4 themes the area of the top corners is large enough to easily grab and drag it with the mouse.</p>
<h3 id="method-5-using-the-window-menu">Method 5: Using the window-menu</h3>
<p>You can also initiate the same action as proposed in <strong>Method 3</strong> above via the window-menu. Accessing the window-menu works either by clicking the menu-button in your window-titlebar (if your Xfwm4 theme has one), or by simply right-clicking the titlebar. There&rsquo;s also a keyboard-shortcut to access the window-menu, but if you only want to resize the window, it&rsquo;s easier to use the direct shortcut for that (again, see <strong>Method 3</strong>).</p>

<h2 id="our-new-branding">Our new branding</h2>
<p>Along with the Beta 2 release of Xubuntu, we are proudly presenting our new branding, including a brand new and shiny logo, refreshed website looks and the few-days-old wallpaper for Precise. Our website also includes a page for <a href="http://xubuntu.org/marketingresources/" title="Marketing Resources">Xubuntu marketing resources</a>, including PNG and SVG versions of the new logo as well as some shiny, new web banners for public use.</p>
<h3 id="without-further-babble-our-new-logo-in-all-its-glory">Without further babble, our new logo in all its glory</h3>

<figure>
    
        <img src="http://localhost:1313/news/releases/12.04/beta-2-released-new-branding/logo-2012.png" alt="Xubuntu logo, 2012 version. Light and dark background versions."/> <figcaption>

                        </p>
                
            </figcaption></figure>

<p>The new logo has a more condensed look and features a more saturated blue. To avoid being superfluous on blue, the logotype is printed on dark grey. It can also be easily replaced with white on darker backgrounds.</p>
<p>The picmark is still based on the <a href="http://xfce.org/">Xfce</a> mouse, but it&rsquo;s more simplified and designed to work better in different contexts and sizes. While the picmark has lost some similarity with the Xfce mouse, reducing the complexity is a logical step from the last logo change.</p>
<h3 id="xubuntu-precise-wallpaper-a-better-experience-for-dual-head-users">Xubuntu Precise wallpaper: a better experience for dual-head users</h3>
<p>The new wallpaper consists of two parts to give dual-head users a better experience with default wallpapers for once. Here&rsquo;s the wallpaper in one, wide piece.</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="http://localhost:1313/news/releases/12.04/beta-2-released-new-branding/precise-wallpaper.png" alt="Xubuntu Precise wallpaper"/> <figcaption>
                <p>

                        </p>
                
            </figcaption></figure>

<p>As some of you notice, the wallpaper has lots of elements previously seen on the Xubuntu wallpapers. That&rsquo;s right, it&rsquo;s intentional. Time to give some homage for the old times. We don&rsquo;t want to go too rusty or dusty, so there&rsquo;s some nice green stuff in, too.</p>
<p>The right side of the wallpaper with the flying bird will be the default wallpaper. If you don&rsquo;t like birds, rather just watch a more plain wallpaper, need to set a wallpaper to the other monitor too or just for fun: we encourage you to try out the left side too!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no certainty that we will keep on providing these wide wallpapers in the future releases, so starting from now is the right time to give feedback. Do you love it? Do you hate it? Should every operating system provide such wallpapers? Should we stick to providing one wallpaper only to keep the decision-making to a minimum?

   </ul>

   <p><strong>Xubuntu Beta 2 is coming out this week and we need testers!</strong></p>
<p>Testing is an excellent way to get involved with Xubuntu. It&rsquo;s a vital part of our release cycle and anyone with a virtual machine (or even better, a spare computer!) can help out with it.</p>
<p>The Xubuntu community maintains extensive documents related to testing, we highly recommend you browse through these as you get more involved with testing:</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Testing">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Testing</a></p>
<p><em>But as a quick start&hellip;</em></p>
<p>Testing Xubuntu is made up of two key sections:</p>
<p>The <strong>Xubuntu <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Testing/TestingInfo">Testing Info</a></strong> page, explaining more about the testing process, including which tests you should conduct.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Testing/TestingInfo/Short">Short Test</a> page, containing specific instructions on how to perform a basic test of Xubuntu. This page includes procedures for both the desktop cd and post-install testing.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Testing/TestingInfo/Long">Long Test</a> page, containing instructions on how to perform a more thorough test of Xubuntu.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The <a href="http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/build/xubuntu/all">QA ISO Testing Tracker</a></strong> page, where testers should report their ISO test results.</p>
<ul>
<li>This tracker is used by both the Ubuntu Release Manager and Ubuntu QA to determine which images will be released for any given milestone.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two testing methods are typically used in tandem, but when you&rsquo;re just starting out you can &ldquo;get your feet wet&rdquo; by trying what you&rsquo;re most comfortable with. You may notice that our testing document document includes more fine-tuned distinctions between <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Testing/TestingInfo#Daily_images_and_Milestone_releases">Daily images and Milestone releases</a> with specific tests we ask people do for each which will help determine whether we&rsquo;re moving forward with a specific milestone release.</p>
<p>To do either of these, you’ll first want to download the ISO as documented on the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Testing/TestingInfo">Testing Info</a> page.</p>
<p>Once you have your .iso file:</p>
<ul>
<li>Burn it to a CD-ROM</li>
<li>Put it on a USB stick (try usb-creator-gtk or UNetbootin)</li>
<li>Use the ISO to load up a new virtual machine in VirtualBox (or similar)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you can select what tests you wish to run. Can you do an install to test the ISO on the <a href="http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/build/xubuntu/all">QA ISO Testing Tracker</a>? Or perhaps just do a live session where you do a <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Testing/TestingInfo/Short">Short Test</a>?</p>
<p>While doing these tests it is important to <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs">file bugs</a>. If you find a bug, please, search if it has already been reported, and if it hasn&rsquo;t, report it yourself. You should also refer to the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingProcedures">debugging guide</a> for that specific package (if available) to make sure you are aware of known issues and have attached the relevant log files.</p>
<p>Have any trouble? Have any questions? Not sure where to report a bug, or if it’s a bug? Join us in #xubuntu-devel on irc.freenode.net (use a client, or access via your browser <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=xubuntu-devel">here</a>) or on the <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/xubuntu-devel">xubuntu-devel mailing list</a>. Please be patient when using either of these resources, our team is small so it may take us some time to respond.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

   <p>After a long, long wait and much hard work, we are ready to proudly present the new Xubuntu website!</p>
<h2 id="new-looks">New looks</h2>
<p>The appearance is updated and more sleek, clean, professional, informative, beautiful and representative. It&rsquo;s easier to navigate on the site. The header area is less obtrusive. Generally speaking, you get faster to the content. We are also <strong>finally</strong> using our new branding.</p>
<h2 id="the-long-awaited-migration">The long-awaited migration</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve switched from Drupal to <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a> under the hood. We are no longer depending on any hacks, neither in the technical side or the appearance side. Administration is easier, which will hopefully result in more frequently updated website. The Xubuntu website team is also much more familiar with WordPress than Drupal, so working the site technically should be much easier in the future as well. The theme was hand-built from scratch, so we do know how to work with that as well. Even in the case we needed to extend or update it.</p>
<h2 id="the-most-important-thing--content">The most important thing – content</h2>
<p>The site is undergoing a massive review of content and content-related issues as well. These things include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hand-picked <a href="http://www.xubuntu.org/news/faq-1110-oneiric/">Frequently Asked Questions -article</a> (and the <a href="http://www.xubuntu.org/news/tag/faq/">FAQ-category</a>), which covers all the most frequently asked questions and will be updated for each release</li>
<li><a href="http://www.xubuntu.org/developertools/">Developer tools</a>, which presents you all the useful tools to get started or keep going with Xubuntu development</li>
<li>Article browsing on the sidebar</li>
<li>Up-to-date screenshots</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;re really sorry that we aren&rsquo;t able to present you all the fruits of the content-reviewing process. While it would have been optimal to release the new website with all-new or at least all-reviewed content, it was more sensible to release what we have now, and fix the rest of the site later. This being said, if you notice any issues in the content, or are willing to help us work on it, please contact us. The best way is to <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/xubuntu-website/+filebug">file a bug</a> or send email to our <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/xubuntu-devel">developer mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, thanks to the following people who helped make this happen: Pasi Lallinaho (knome), Elizabeth Krumbach (pleia2), madnick, Bruno A. Benitez (GridCube), Simon Steinbeiß (ochosi), Phil Whitaker (beardygnome), Unit193, Steve Dodier (SiDi) and all the others who helped us testing the site or gave any feedback.</p>

   <h3 id="1-i-cant-hear-a-sound-how-can-i-get-my-sound-back">1. I can’t hear a sound. How can I get my sound back?</h3>
<p>There are many reasons why sound can be lost on a system, most of them if you try to use different audio protocols. The usual way to get sound back is to run <code>sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart</code>.</p>
<p>If this doesn’t work you can try running <code>sudo alsa force-unload</code> and <code>sudo alsa force-reload</code>.</p>
<p>Pulseaudio can sometimes cause conflicts with ALSA. If you are sure you don’t need one or the other, you could try purging pulseaudio with <code>sudo apt-get purge pulseaudio</code>.</p>
<p>If you still have problems please join the forums or IRC channels and feel free to ask all the questions you need.</p>
<h3 id="2-i-need-a-program-to-do-thing-x-how-do-i-install-it">2. I need a program (to do thing) X, how do I install it?</h3>

   </ul>

   <p>The first beta release of Xubuntu 11.10 &ldquo;Oneiric Ocelot&rdquo; has arrived. The developers are working hard to make Xubuntu 11.10 one of the best Linux distributions yet. They are striving to ensure that everything will work for all users, and instead of many changes, are working to ensure the release is very stable and secure.</p>
<p>This is still a testing build designed for developers and is not suggested for anyone looking for a stable system. Please do not install Oneiric Ocelot on your production system.</p>
<p><em>Changes (since Alpha 1 - Xubuntu specific):</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Xubuntu has replaced gdm with lightdm as the application that manages logins. Automatic logins will not work with lightdm at the present time. We are sure lightdm is going to provide a much better experience for the users than gdm.</li>
<li>Pastebinit is now included in Xubuntu intallations by default. If you need to use <a href="http://paste.ubuntu.com/">http://paste.ubuntu.com/</a>, you can use pastebinit to paste directly without copying and pasting the data.</li>
<li>The developers have replaced mousepad with leafpad as the text editor. leafpad now includes the ability to print, and is better maintained than mousepad.</li>
<li>The onscreen keyboard, Onboard, is now included in the default Xubuntu menus, under Accessories. For those who require an onscreen keyboard, this will be much easier to access using only a mouse or touchpad.</li>
<li>Astute users will observe a new plymouth splash screen in use. Unfortunately, we have found that occasionally, when using the desktop cd to install, the message &ldquo;hit any key to continue&rdquo; will not appear. Should you get a black screen with text and the sliding throbber, when the throbber stops moving and the cd ejects, remove the cd and hit enter on the keyboard to continue.</li>
<li>Bluetooth does not work at the present time in Xubuntu. Please see the bug below. A workaround is to install &lsquo;blueman&rsquo; to manage bluetooth.</li>
<li>The Xubuntu developers and contributors had a discussion about replacing the Gimp with an application to assist with digital photos. As a result, gThumb has been added to the default installation. This application is designed to help with image transformations and viewing.</li>
<li>(Users must select a session when logging in the first time. If no session is selected, the user will see the Ubuntu wallpaper, and nothing else. In this case, go to a tty using Ctrl+Alt+F2, login, and type: sudo service lightdm restart Now the user can login again, and select the session.)</li>

   <p>The second and final beta release of Xubuntu 11.04 &ldquo;Natty Narwhal&rdquo; has arrived. This is a testing build designed for testers and developers and is <strong>not suggested for anyone looking for a stable system</strong>. This beta replaces the traditional Release Candidate - the stable version for end-users will be released <strong>April 28th 2011</strong>, so these last two weeks of testing are of utmost importance for a stable release.</p>

         Xubuntu Natty Artwork

      <li><time datetime="2011-03-09T09:25:23&#43;00:00">March 9, 2011</time></li>

   </ul>

   <p>As one of Xubuntu&rsquo;s artwork contributors and member of the <a href="http://www.shimmerproject.org">Shimmerproject</a> I would like to take some time now - towards the end of this cycle - and discuss (at least parts of) the design process during the development phase for Natty (11.04). This is planned as a <em>review</em> and in a way (implicitely) a <em>preview</em>: you can see the direction Xubuntu is heading for since Maverick and Natty and hopefully the project will continue this way.</p>
<h3 id="looking-back-on-the-previous-release-aka-maverick">Looking back on the previous release (aka Maverick)</h3>
<p>We started out in early November to analyze what had happened during the Maverick cycle and I realized that with a few aspects of that particular cycle I was really unhappy. For one we started out with developing Bluebird (Maverick&rsquo;s new theme, which was designed as a bright pendant to the well-proven Albatross) very late and also other changes (mostly icons) were done at the last minute. Therefore we didn&rsquo;t have time to (<strong>1</strong>) go through sufficient testing and (<strong>2</strong>) gather feedback to evaluate and fine-tune the theme. Other than that the cooperation with the Xubuntu team worked fine, although I think we didn&rsquo;t communicate enough.</p>
<h3 id="evaluating-the-current-cycle-aka-natty">Evaluating the current cycle (aka Natty)</h3>
<p>In Natty we started pretty early, basically shortly after Maverick was released in late October of 2010 and I continuously developed <em>&ldquo;Greybird&rdquo;</em>, which is code-wise and experience-wise based on <em>Bluebird</em>. We got a lot of feedback from the community that suggested that the blue tones were too intense and in general the reactions were polarizing (meaning: some really liked it, other really disliked it). Therefore I decided to take a different approach and start again with <em>less colors</em> (hence the codename &ldquo;Greybird&rdquo;) and see where we would get with that. Charlie (Xubuntu&rsquo;s Project Leader) decided already during Maverick that one focus of Natty development should be accessibility, in my approach for Greybird these <em>two motivations</em> (less colors for daily use, accessibility) played along very nicely. The whole development process was (at least semi-)public from the beginning, the members of the Xubuntu community provided feedback during the community-meetings and as we felt ready we went public and links and screenshots were published and discussed on various blogs.</p>
<p>Other than the <em>gtk-theme</em> we also did a new <em>xfwm4-theme</em> (based on the elementary-theme by the elementary Team) and decided to go for <em>bigger changes with the panels</em>, making use of the new functions we gained from Xfce4.8. There&rsquo;s now the top panel that traditionally shows the menu-button and system-tray, but now it also contains the list of open windows. So basically the functionality of the two panels has been merged into one. I think the <em>gain in vertical screen estate</em> will be appreciated by users of 16:10 or 16:9 resolutions. In the lower edge we decided to auto-hide the launcher panel, the applications we consider most important for a new user are only one click away with that. This panel is easily customizable, to create new launchers simply drag and drop them from either the menu, appfinder or /usr/share/applications in Thunar. Since the compositor is now switched on by default we can make use of the new panel&rsquo;s gorgeous alpha-transparency and the lower launcher-panel looks beautifully semi-transparent.</p>
<p>One more issue that we were able to fix because we started with artwork so early in the cycle is the <em>resize-grips</em>, which are now shown in practically every window. Since most other urgent things were fixed already it was possible for us to focus on that issue and solve it gracefully: we now have a beautiful and accessible resize-grip in Greybird.</p>
<h3 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h3>
<p>As most of you know the UI-freeze is still some time away, so some things are still in the move. I had more plans for Natty than I was (or will be) able to finish in time (some of those plans and ideas developed throughout the cycle though), so I hope we will take the time and improve our project management by one more step: adding a roadmap for Natty+1 shortly after the release in April.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="find-what-youre-looking-for-with-catfish">Find what you&rsquo;re looking for with Catfish</h4>
<p>With Xubuntu 8.10, you&rsquo;ll find an option to &ldquo;Search for Files&rdquo; in the Places menu. Clicking this will present you with the widely popular, light-weight search front-end called Catfish. Catfish enables you to quickly and easily search for your documents, music, pictures, videos, and more.</p>
<p>For the technically inclined, Catfish is a frontend for different search engines (daemons).</p>
<p>You can employ find, slocate, locate, doodle, tracker, beagle, strigi and pinot - what ever tickles your fancy!</p>
<h4 id="easily-manage-your-secrets">Easily manage your secrets</h4>
<p>Xubuntu 8.10 includes the well known secret keeper Seahorse. Seahorse is a GTK front end for GnuPG - the Gnu Privacy Guard program. It is a tool for secure communications and data storage. Data encryption and digital signature creation can easily be performed through a GUI and Key Management operations can easily be carried out through an intuitive interface.</p>
<h4 id="xorg-74">X.Org 7.4</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.x.org/wiki/Releases/7.4">X.Org 7.4</a>, the latest stable version of <a href="http://www.x.org/wiki/">X.Org</a>, is available in this version. This release brings much better support for hot-pluggable input devices such as tablets, keyboards, and mice. At the same time this will allow the great majority of users to run without a /etc/X11/xorg.conf file. A new failsafe X is introduced, to give better tools for troubleshooting X startup failures.</p>
<p>Two of the older nvidia binary drivers are not available for X.Org 7.4 yet, so users of these drivers will be automatically switched to the corresponding open source drivers.</p>
<h4 id="linux-kernel-2627">Linux kernel 2.6.27</h4>
<p>Xubuntu 8.10 includes Linux kernel 2.6.27, a significant release with better hardware support and numerous bug-fixes.</p>
<h4 id="encrypted-private-directory">Encrypted private directory</h4>
<p>The ecryptfs-utils package was recently promoted to Ubuntu main, with support for a <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EncryptedPrivateDirectory">secret encrypted folder</a> in your Home Folder (by Michael Halcrow, Dustin Kirkland, and Daniel Baumann).</p>
<h4 id="network-manager-07">Network Manager 0.7</h4>
<p>Xubuntu 8.10 ships Network Manager 0.7 (by Dan Williams and others), which comes with long-expected features, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>system wide settings (i.e., no need to log in in order to get a connection)</li>
<li>management of 3G connections (GSM/CDMA)</li>
<li>management of multiple active devices at once</li>
<li>management of PPP and PPPOE connections</li>
<li>management of devices with static IP configurations</li>
<li>route management for devices</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="dkms">DKMS</h4>
<p><a href="http://linux.dell.com/dkms">DKMS</a> (by Dell) is included in Xubuntu 8.10, allowing kernel drivers to be automatically rebuilt when new kernels are released. This makes it possible for kernel package updates to be made available immediately without waiting for rebuilds of driver packages, and without third-party driver packages becoming out of date when installing these kernel updates.</p>
<h4 id="samba-32">Samba 3.2</h4>
<p>A lot of new features have been added in Samba 3.2 amongst them:</p>
<ul>
<li>clustered file server support</li>
<li>encrypted network transport</li>
<li>ipv6 support</li>
<li>better integration with the latest version of Microsoft Windows™ clients and servers.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="pam-authentication-framework">PAM authentication framework</h4>
<p>Xubuntu 8.10 features a new pam-auth-update tool, which allows simple management of PAM authentication configuration for both desktops and servers (by Steve Langasek). Packages providing PAM modules will be configured automatically, and users can adjust their authentication preferences by running sudo pam-auth-update.</p>
<p>More information can be found in the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PAMConfigFrameworkSpec">Ubuntu wiki</a>.</p>
<h4 id="totem-bbc-plugin">Totem BBC plugin</h4>
<p>Xubuntu 8.10 features a new plugin for the Totem movie player that fetches free digital content from the BBC. To enable it, start Totem (Applications -&gt; Multimedia -&gt; Movie Player), enable the plugin (Edit -&gt; Plugins -&gt; BBC content viewer) and select &ldquo;BBC&rdquo; from the drop-down labelled &ldquo;Playlist&rdquo;.</p>
