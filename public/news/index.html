Xubuntu 23.04, featuring the latest updates from Xfce 4.18 and GNOME 44.</p>
<p>Xubuntu 23.04 features the latest Xfce 4.18. Xfce 4.18 delivers a stable desktop environment with a number of performance improvements and new features to enjoy. In particular, the Thunar file manager benefits from a new image preview feature, undo and redo functionality, file highlights, and recursive search. Check out the <a href="https://www.xfce.org/about/tour418">Xfce 4.18</a> tour for more details!</p>
<p>Xubuntu 23.04 also welcomes <strong>Xubuntu Minimal</strong> as an official subproject. Xubuntu Minimal is a slimmed down version of Xubuntu that only includes the bare essentials: the desktop, a few Xfce components, and the Xubuntu look and feel. Longtime Xubuntu fans may better know this as <em><a href="https://xubuntu.org/news/introducing-xubuntu-core/">Xubuntu Core</a></em>. After nearly eight years of being a supported, but community-built project, we&rsquo;re happy to finally publish downloads along with the main Xubuntu version. Many thanks to the community for keeping the dream alive all these years!</p>

All of the submissions are browsable on the <a href="https://contest.xubuntu.org/wallpaper_contest/xubuntu-22-04-community-wallpaper-contest/?action=view">22.04 contest page at contest.xubuntu.org</a>.</p>

         <li>qa, testing-week</li>
      
   </ul>

   <p>We&rsquo;re delighted to announce that we&rsquo;re participating in another ‘Ubuntu Testing Week’ from April 1st to April 7th with other flavours in the <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/flavours">Ubuntu family</a>. On April 1st, the beta version of Xubuntu 21.04 ‘Hirsute Hippo’ will be released after halting all new changes to its features, user interface and documentation. Between April 1st and the final release on April 22nd, all efforts by the Xubuntu team and community should be focused on ISO testing, reporting bugs, fixing bugs, and translations.</p>
<p>It has been a year since we last did a collaboration with other Ubuntu flavors for an Ubuntu Testing Week, which was done for <a href="https://xubuntu.org/news/xubuntu-20-04-testing-week/">Xubuntu 20.04 LTS</a>. That event was a major success, as a large volume of testers participated and it was announced on various linux news sites and podcasts. Alan Pope (aka Popey) from Canonical, Rick Timmis from the Kubuntu team, and Bill from the Ubuntu Mate team helped spread the word about the previous event in this clip from Big Daddy Linux Live (BDLL) on how the event came about, its goals, as well as points on how to test. You won’t want to miss being part of the event this year! Read on to learn how.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>During the testing week you can download the <a href="http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/daily-live/current/">daily ISO image</a> and try it out, though you are welcome to start from today. You can test without changing your system by running it in a VM (Virtual Machine) with software like <a href="https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/downloads/details?downloadGroup=PLAYER-1610&amp;productId=1039&amp;rPId=55792">VMWare Player</a>, VirtualBox (<a href="apt://virtualbox-qt">apt-install</a>) and Gnome Boxes (<a href="apt://gnome-boxes">apt-install</a>), or you may run it from a USB, SD Card, or DVD, to test if your hardware works correctly. You can use software like<a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/"> Etcher</a> and Gnome Disks (<a href="apt://gnome-disk-utility">apt-install</a>) to copy the ISO to a USB Drive or SD Card, while apps like Brasero (<a href="apt://brasero">apt-install</a>) and Xfburn (<a href="apt://xfburn">apt-install</a>) can be used to burn it to DVD. We encourage those that are willing, to install it either in a VM or on physical hardware (it requires at least 15GB of hard disk space) and use it for a few days, as more bugs can be discovered and reported this way.</p>
<p>There are a variety of ways that you can help test the release, including trying out the various live session and installation test cases from the <a href="http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/milestones/419/builds">ISO tracker</a>, which take less than 30 minutes to complete (<a href="https://youtu.be/hXLiqjOkSmg?t=242">example 1</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ou1-zRSo-8">example 2</a>, example 3 below). If you find a bug, you’ll need a <a href="https://login.launchpad.net/">Launchpad account</a> to file it against the package the app is bundled in, which you can find by watching this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjTyzyY9RHw">Easy Bug Reporting By Example</a> video. If the bug is found in the installer, you can file it against<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity"> ubiquity</a>, or you can file it against the <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux">linux</a> package, if your hardware isn’t working.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Please test apps that you regularly use, so you can identify bugs and regressions that should be reported, especially as the recently released <a href="https://xfce.org/about/news/?post=1608595200">Xfce 4.16</a> is bundled in this release. You can learn about what else is new in this release in the <a href="https://wiki.xubuntu.org/releases/21.04/release-notes">Release Notes</a>. New ISO files are built everyday, and you should always test with the most up-to-date ISO. It is easier and faster to update an existing daily ISO file on Linux with the command below (you’ll need to run it in the terminal from within the folder with the ISO file).</p>
<p><code>$ zsync http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/daily-live/current/hirsute-desktop-amd64.iso.zsync</code></p>
<p>We look forward to you joining us to make Xubuntu 21.04 an even bigger success, and hope that you will also test out the other Ubuntu flavours. The success of the previous event was mentioned by the former Ubuntu Desktop Lead Martin Wimpress (aka Wimpy) in the Ubuntu Podcast <a href="https://ubuntupodcast.org/2020/04/12/s13e03-spilling-salt/">Season 13 Episode 03</a> at 20:21 where he said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;&hellip; It is definitely paying dividends. In the nicest way possible, they made members of the Desktop Team cry today. We had our weekly team meeting where we go through all the bug reports to triage them and usually there are some, and there were pages of them and we didn&rsquo;t get through them all. So we are scheduling another bug triage meeting later this week in order to pick up where we left off from. But this is great because we are actually getting decent bug reports that we can work with and [take] action [on] and improve what will be the final release in 3 weeks time. So for all the tears that were shed, it was definitely a worthwhile endeavor because these are bugs that other people would encounter when they install 20.04 for the first time. So thank you everyone that was involved in that effort. It was much appreciated.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are welcome to chat with us live in our dedicated telegram groups ( <a href="https://t.me/UbuntuTesters">Ubuntu Testers</a>, <a href="https://t.me/XubuntuDevelopment">Xubuntu Development</a> ) or IRC channel ( <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/#ubuntu-quality?nick=ubuntu-tester?w">#ubuntu-quality</a> on freenode ).

   <p>On Tuesday, May 18th, the <a href="http://ubottu.com/meetingology/logs/xubuntu-devel/2020/xubuntu-devel.2020-05-19-21.02.log.html#l-120">Xubuntu Team voted</a> to migrate some of our infrastructure away from Launchpad to <a href="https://github.com/Xubuntu">GitHub</a> for code hosting, while translations are now on <a href="https://www.transifex.com/xubuntu/public/">Transifex</a>. Here&rsquo;s a summary of the changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have a new GitHub organization, under the Xubuntu name. Each subteam has an equivalent in the new organization.</li>
<li>All codebases have been migrated to GitHub.</li>
<li>All translations have moved to Transifex.</li>
<li>Every codebase moved to GitHub has been mirrored on Launchpad. This supports our daily package builds, and allows community members to continue using only Launchpad if they choose.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following functionality has not changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issues are still reported on Launchpad for each package, and <code>ubuntu-bug</code> continues to work as it always has.</li>
<li>PPAs and daily package builds will continue to be updated as normal.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-github">Why GitHub?</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve chosen to move to GitHub to make it easier for individuals to contribute to the project. As one of the largest platforms for software development, this is where we can reach the largest number of potential contributors while eliminating various barriers to entry. Here&rsquo;s just some of the reasons we&rsquo;re moving:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ubuntu and many of its flavors already host their code on GitHub.</li>
<li>Many of our upstream and downstream projects are already on GitHub or have mirrors there.</li>
<li>GitHub&rsquo;s Web IDE simplifies contributions. Non-technical users can easily submit changes to their favorite projects, and maintainers can accept them just as easily.</li>
<li>Discoverability is improved. All of Xubuntu&rsquo;s projects can be found from <a href="https://github.com/xubuntu">a single page</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-transifex">Why Transifex?</h2>
<p>Transifex is a popular, web-based translation platform. They support open source projects by making their solutions free for any FOSS project, and have long been the translation solution for our primary upstream, Xfce. With their simple GitHub integration, we were able to quickly and easily move and have our translations automatically syncing in both directions.</p>
<p>To find all of our projects needing translators and to sign up, just visit our public page: <a href="https://www.transifex.com/xubuntu/public/">https://www.transifex.com/xubuntu/public/</a></p>
<h2 id="okay-great-now-what">Okay, Great! Now What?</h2>
<p>We encourage everybody to join us in breaking in our new platforms. Here&rsquo;s how you can get started:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Watch</strong> and <strong>star</strong> our projects! Watching a project will keep you in the loop for the latest changes. <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/saving-repositories-with-stars">Starring</a> a project will make it easier to find in the future, and help you discover similar projects.</li>
<li><strong>Fork</strong> our projects! <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo">Forking</a> a repository makes a copy under your own profile. Make some changes and submit a pull request to include them in Xubuntu.</li>
<li>Join the translations team! Xubuntu is used all around the world. Help us localize our software and documentation to make a global impact.</li>

   <p>The Xubuntu team is happy to announce the immediate release of Xubuntu 20.04. Xubuntu 20.04, codenamed <strong>Focal Fossa</strong>, is a long-term support (LTS) release and will be supported for 3 years, until April 2023.</p>
<p>The Xubuntu team has been hard at work for the last six months of this development cycle improving both the Xfce desktop environment and the Xubuntu user experience following our 19.10 release, which introduced Xfce 4.14 for the first time. We were thrilled by the response to the <a href="https://xubuntu.org/news/xubuntu-20-04-testing-week/">Ubuntu Testing Week</a>, which helped us make 20.04 another great and stable release.</p>
<p>The <strong>final release images</strong> are available as torrents and direct downloads from <a href="https://xubuntu.org/download/">xubuntu.org/download/</a>.</p>
<p>As the main server might be busy in the first few days after the release, we recommend using the torrents if possible.</p>
<p><strong>Xubuntu Core</strong>, our minimal installation option, is available to download from <a href="https://unit193.net/xubuntu/core/">unit193.net/xubuntu/core/</a> [<a href="https://fosstorrents.com/files/download.php?file=xubuntu-20.04-core-amd64.iso.torrent">torrent</a>, <a href="magnet:?xt=urn:btih:11b377a1c8b9274f4103f5eee23cb659c3acf1ce&amp;dn=xubuntu-20.04-core-amd64.iso&amp;tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.unit193.net%3a6969&amp;tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3a6969">magnet</a>].

         <li>qa, testing-week</li>
      
   </ul>

   <p>We&rsquo;re delighted to announce that we&rsquo;re participating in an ‘Ubuntu Testing Week’ from April 2nd to April 8th with other flavors in the Ubuntu family. On April 2nd, we’ll be releasing the beta release of Xubuntu 20.04 LTS, after halting all new changes to its features, user interface and documentation. And between April 2nd and the final release on April 23rd, all efforts by the Xubuntu team and community are focused on ISO testing, bug reporting, and fixing bugs.</p>
<p>So, we highly encourage you to join the community by downloading the <a href="http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/daily-live/current/">daily ISO image</a> and trying it out, though you are welcome to start from today. There are a variety of ways that you can help test the release, including trying out the various testcases for live sessions and installations on the <a href="http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/milestones/408/builds">ISO tracker</a> (Xubuntu is found at the bottom of the page), which take less than 30 minutes to complete (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXLiqjOkSmg&amp;t=242">example 1</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ou1-zRSo-8">example 2</a>, example 3 below).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can test without changing your system by running it in a VM (Virtual Machine) with software like <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html">VMWare Player</a>, <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a> (<a href="apt://virtualbox-qt">apt-install</a>), and <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Boxes">Gnome Boxes</a> (<a href="apt://gnome-boxes">apt-install</a>), or running it in the live session from a USB, SD Card, or DVD, so you can also test if your hardware works correctly. There are a number of software like <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">etcher</a> and <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Disks">Gnome Disks</a> that can copy the ISO to a USB Drive and SD Card. We encourage those that are willing, to install it either in a VM or on physical hardware (it requires at least 6GB of harddisk space) and use it continuously for a few days, as more bugs can be reported this way.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you find a bug in the installer, you can file it against <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity">ubiquity</a>, or if you find a bug not in an application but in the live session from the booting to the shutdown, you can file it against <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/casper">casper</a>. If you can’t figure out which package to file a bug against after watching the video above, then please file it with the <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/~xubuntu-bugs">Xubuntu Bugs Team</a>.</p>
<p>Please test apps that you regularly use, so you can identify bugs and regressions that should be reported. New ISO files are built everyday, and you should always test with the most up-to-date ISO. It is easier and faster to update an existing daily ISO file on Linux by running the command below in the folder containing the ISO, after right-click on the folder and select ‘Open in Terminal’ from the context menu (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf0CC2fPxoU">example</a>).</p>
<p><code>$ zsync http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/daily-live/current/focal-desktop-amd64.iso.zsync</code></p>
<p>In order to assist you in your testing efforts, we encourage you to read our <a href="https://xubuntu.org/contribute/qa">Quality Assurance (QA) guide</a> and our <a href="https://wiki.xubuntu.org/qa/new_tester_start">new testers wiki</a>. You can also chat with us live in our dedicated IRC channel ( <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/#ubuntu-quality?nick=xubuntu-tester?w">#ubuntu-quality</a> on freenode ) or telegram group ( <a href="https://t.me/UbuntuTesters">Ubuntu Testers</a> ). In order to submit reports to us, you’ll need an <a href="https://login.launchpad.net/">Launchpad account</a> and once you have one, you can also join the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~xubuntu-testers">Xubuntu Testers team</a>.</p>
<p>We hope that you will join the community in making Xubuntu 20.04 a success, and hope that you will also take time to also test out the other Ubuntu flavors (Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Ubuntu, Ubuntu Budgie, Ubuntu Kylin, Ubuntu MATE, and Ubuntu Studio), as we will all benefit from that. We look forward to your contributions, your live chatting and for your return to future testing sessions. Happy bug hunting.</p>

<h2 id="highlights-and-known-issues">Highlights and Known Issues</h2>
<h3 id="highlights">Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Xubuntu 19.10 features Xfce 4.14, released in August 2019 after nearly 4.5 years of development. Backed by GTK 3 and other modern technologies, Xfce 4.14 includes many new features, improved HiDPI support, and the same great performance for which Xfce is known.</li>
<li>Xfce Screensaver replaces Light Locker for screen locking. The new screensaver is built on years of development from the GNOME and MATE Screensaver projects and is tightly integrated with Xfce. It also features significantly improved support for Laptops.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ve added two new keyboard shortcuts to make transitioning from other desktop environments and operating systems easier.
<ul>
<li><strong>Super + D</strong> will show your desktop, while</li>
<li><strong>Super + L</strong> will now lock your screen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ZFS on root is included as an experimental feature. Available in Ubuntu and the other flavors for this first time in 19.10, this feature enables full-disk installation of ZFS.
<ul>
<li><strong>Remember, ZFS on root is experimental, so don&rsquo;t run it on your production machines!</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="known-issues">Known Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>If more than one instance of the Xfce Pulseaudio Plugin is added to the panel, volume notifications will be duplicated.</li>
<li>Tooltips can become unresponsive in the Xfce Task Manager. Usually a bit of movement will cause the tooltip to fade away.

   <p>During the last few weeks of the 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) cycle, we had 2 people drop by in our development channel trying to respond to the <a href="https://xubuntu.org/news/testing-for-xubuntu/">call</a> for testers from the Development and QA Teams.</p>
<p>It quickly became apparent to me that I was having to repeat myself in order to make it &ldquo;basic&rdquo; enough for someone who had never tested for us, to understand what I was trying to put across.</p>
<p>After pointing to the various resources we have, and other flavours use - it transpired that they both would have preferred something a bit easier to start with.</p>
<p>So I asked them to write it for us all.</p>
<p>Rather than belabour my point here, I&rsquo;ve asked both of them to write a few words about what they needed and what they have achieved for everyone.</p>
<p>Before they get that chance – I would just like to thank them both for the hours of work they have put in drafting, tweaking and getting the pages into a position where we can tell you all of their existence.</p>
<p>You can see the fruits of their labour at our updated web page for <a href="https://xubuntu.org/contribute/qa">Testers</a> and the new pages we have at the <a href="https://wiki.xubuntu.org/qa/new_tester_start">New Tester wiki</a>.</p>
<p>Kev On behalf of the Xubuntu Development and QA Teams.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I see the whole idea of OS software and communities helping themselves as a breath of fresh air in an ever more profit obsessed world (yes, I am a cynical old git).</p>
<p>I really wanted to help, but just didn&rsquo;t think that I had any of the the skills required, and the guides always seemed to assume a level of knowledge that I just didn&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>So, when I was asked to help write a &lsquo;New Testers&rsquo; guide for my beloved Xubuntu I absolutely jumped at the chance, knowing that my ignorance was my greatest asset.</p>
<p>I hope what resulted from our work will help those like me (people who can easily learn but need to be told pretty much everything from the bottom up) to start testing and enjoy the warm, satisfied glow of contributing to their community. Most of all, I really enjoyed collaborating with some very nice people indeed.&rdquo; <a href="https://launchpad.net/~b-leigh">Leigh Sutherland</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I marvel at how we live in an age in which we can collaborate and share with people all over the world - as such I really like the ideas of free and open source. A long time happy Xubuntu user, I felt the time to be involved, to go from user-only to contributor was long overdue - Xubuntu is a community effort after all. So, when the call for testing came last March, I dove in. At first testing seemed daunting, complicated and very technical. But, with leaps and bounds, and the endless patience and kindness of the Xubuntu-bunch over at Xubuntu-development, I got going. I felt I was at last &ldquo;paying back&rdquo;. When flocculant asked if I would help him and Leigh to write some pages to make the information about testing more accessible for users like me, with limited technical skills and knowledge, I really liked the idea. And that started a collaboration I really enjoyed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my hope that with these pages we&rsquo;ve been able to get across the information needed by someone like I was when I started -technical newby, noob- to simply get set up to get testing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also my hope people like you will tell us where and how these pages can be improved, with the aim to make the first forays into testing as gentle and easy as possible. Because without testing we as a community can not make xubuntu as good as we&rsquo;d want it to be.&rdquo; <a href="https://launchpad.net/~whobers">Willem Hobers</a></p>

   <p>Xubuntu 18.04 “Bionic Beaver” is just around the corner. The first beta milestone arrives next week, and the final release is a little over a month away. 18.04 is an LTS release, meaning it has a 3-year support cycle and is definitely recommended for all users. Or it would be, if we knew it was ready. Stick around&hellip; this is a bit of a long read, but it’s important.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/">ISO Tracker</a> has seen little activity for the last few development cycles. We know we have some excited users already using and testing 18.04. But without testing results being recorded anywhere, we have to assume that nobody is testing the daily images and milestones. And this has major implications for both the 18.04 release and the project as a whole.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the QA team, and with full support from the development team - If we aren’t able to gauge an ISO at any of the milestones (Beta, Final Beta, Release Candidate, and the LTS Point Release), how can we possibly mark those as “Ready for Release”? And why should we?</p>
<p>It is notable that following any of our releases, often within less than a day, we have multiple reports of issues that were NEVER seen on the ISO Tracker. With the current <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates">SRU procedure</a>, this means that all users will now have a minimum of 7 days before they can possibly see a fix. With development and testing time, these fixes may take significantly longer or never even make it into the 3-year support release.</p>
<p>Xubuntu is a community project. That includes all of you. If the community doesn’t care until it’s too late, what should we take from that? In fact, community support is part of the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecognizedFlavors">deal</a> every flavor makes with Canonical to enable all of the things that make it possible for the flavor to exist. It’s actually the first bullet point in remaining a recognized flavor:</p>
<ul>
<li>Image has track record of community interested in creating, supporting and promoting its use.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ready-to-help-lets-do-this">Ready to help? Let’s do this.</h2>
<p>It is now time for the community to step up. Test ISOs, test the versions of packages you regularly use, check for any regressions, and record your results! Our ISO builds <strong>EVERY</strong> day around 0200UTC and the newest daily ISO is then available shortly after. The daily build can always be found on the <a href="http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/daily-live/current/">daily builds</a> page, regardless of the current development release name.</p>
<p>For those of you who do not believe you can help… you can!</p>
<h3 id="regression-testing">Regression Testing</h3>
<p>How hard is it to check for regression? Use the software you use every day. Does it work differently than it used to?</p>
<ul>
<li>If not, no regression!</li>
<li>If it does, but works better than before, no regression!</li>
<li>Anything else, you’ve found a regression.<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs#Reporting_non-crash_hardware_and_desktop_application_bugs"> Report it !</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="iso-testing">ISO Testing</h3>
<p>How hard is it to check an ISO? If you have at 1Gb of disk space available, read on.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have sufficient disk space for a 10Gb file, you can probably use a virtual machine to run installation and post-installation tests.</li>
<li>If you are able to virtualize but lack the disk space for a full installation, consider using a VM to verify the ISO boots and applications run on the live disk.</li>
<li>If you have physical media available, either a DVD-R (RW to not waste the media on daily tests) or 2+ Gb capacity USB stick, you can boot Xubuntu from the media and perform installation, post-installation, and live testing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="more-information">More Information</h3>
<p>In May of 2017, we ran a session on IRC for prospective testers. Other than our regular visitors, one new prospective tester attended and shared in the discussion. The logs for that session are<a href="https://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2017/05/12/%23xubuntu-devel.html"> still available</a> if you want to spend 10 minutes checking out how easy it is to help.</p>
<p>We hope that you’ll join us in making Xubuntu 18.04 a success. We think it’s going to be the best release ever, but if the community can’t find the time to contribute to the release, we can’t guarantee we can have one.</p>

<li>The GNOME Font Viewer is now included by default. This application simplifies viewing and installing fonts.</li>
<li>Client side decorations (CSD) now consume much less space with the Greybird GTK+ theme.</li>
<li>New device, mimetype, and monochrome panel icons have been included with the elementary-xfce icon theme.</li>
</ul>
<p>We usually link directly to the Ubuntu release notes, but there are several significant improvements that affect all flavors and our users:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accelerated video playback with Intel hardware</strong> should now work more reliably out of the box. The changes might also bring some performance improvements for Parole and Chromium users. <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IntelQuickSyncVideo">More information here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Bluetooth and USB audio devices</strong> should now work better by default due to changes in BlueZ and PulseAudio.</li>
<li><strong>Driverless printing</strong> has been added to Ubuntu. This provides support for most modern printers: IPP Everywhere, Apple AirPrint, Mopria, PCLm, and Wifi Direct as supported. Other printers can still be added from the Printers dialog.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="known-issues">Known Issues</h3>
<p>System encryption password set before setting keyboard locale (<a href="https://launchpad.net/bugs/1047384">1047384</a>). Workaround: Start the installation with the correct keymap. <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions#Changing_the_CD.27s_Default_Boot_Options">Use F3</a> to set your keymap before booting to Try or Install Xubuntu from that menu.</p>
<p>Currently at times the panel can show 2 network icons, this appears to be a race condition which we have not been able to rectify in time for release. While this is an appearance issue only as far as we know, you can if you wish restart networking, the affected plugin or the panel. This fixes the issue in your running session but does not prevent the issue from re-appearing.</p>

         Xubuntu Quality Assurance team is spreading out

   </ul>

   <p>Up until the start of the 17.04 cycle the Xubuntu Quality Assurance team had been led by one person. During the last cycle, a break was needed by that person. The recent addition of Dave Pearson to the team meant we were in a position to call on someone else to lead the team.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re pleased to announce that Dave will be carrying on as a team lead. However, starting with the artfully named Artful Aardvark cycle, we will migrate to a Quality Assurance team with two leads who will be sharing duties during development cycles.</p>
<p>While Dave was in control of the show during 17.04, Kev was spending more time upstream with <a href="https://xfce.org/">Xfce</a>, involving himself in testing GTK3 ports with Simon. The QA team plans to continue this split roughly from this point; Dave will be running the daily Xubuntu QA and Kev will focus more on the QA for Xfce. For the most part it is unlikely that much change will be seen by most, given that for the most part we&rsquo;re quiet during a cycle (QA team notes: even if the majority of -dev mailing list posts come from us&hellip;) – other than shouting when things need you all to join in.</p>
<p>While it is obvious to most that there are deep connections between Xubuntu and Xfce, we hope that this change will bring more targetted testing of the new GTK3 Xfce packages. You will start to see more calls for testing of packages before they reach Xubuntu on the Xubuntu development mailing list. Case in point, the recent requests for people to test Thunar and patches direct from the Xfce Git repositories – though up until now this has come via Launchpad bug reports.</p>
<p>On a positive note this change has solely been possible by the creation of the Xubuntu QA Launchpad team some cycles ago. Specifically set up to allow people from the community to be brought in to the Xubuntu setup and from there become members of the Xubuntu team itself. People do get noticed on the tracker and they do get noticed on our IRC channels. Our hope is that we are able to increase the numbers of people in Xubuntu QA from the few we currently have. Increasing numbers of people involved, help us increase the quality and strength of the team directly.</p>

<p>After seeing a simple metal cookie cutter created by the Xubuntu Marketing lead, Keith was inspired to make a plastic 3D-printed version of the Xubuntu cookie cutter. He printed several of them and also shared the design on Thingiverse so others could also print it.</p>

<p>We run a small business, mainly doing computer service and maintenance, app programming and other similar things. One of the things we do are customized Linux desktops, where we build a user interface based around a customers wishes; tweaking everything from themes, colors and fonts to panels, widgets and other content. When we started doing this we tried out and evaluated loads of distributions and desktop environments, eventually deciding that Xubuntu was the perfect choice. We wanted to maximize the amount of customization we could do while still having a system that was light on resources (since customers often have old computers.)</p>
<p>It was a choice we have never regretted, as it has always fit our needs perfectly. We can get everything from design to workflow just as we want it, and it is stable as rock while still often introducing new features for us to play with.</p>
<p>One of our best experiences was with a person who wanted an interface on a laptop that was just as simple and scaled down as that of an iPad, while still being able to do all things a computer ought to do. This was not an especially computer-savvy person, so it needed to be straightforward and simple. We managed to discard most classic desktop parameters and build a very unique interface, all within what was provided by stock Xubuntu. (Though we did some art ourselves.) It turned out great, our customer was very happy with it and other people have shown interest in having something similar on their computers. Needless to say, this was a success story for us which had not been possible without Xubuntu.</p>
<p>So thanks for all your hard work! We keep on designing our users desktops and will continue to use the excellent Xubuntu for it. :)</p>

<p>I live in Israel, and in Hebrew, the slang word &ldquo;Zubi&rdquo; is an insolent and extreme way to say &ldquo;No way I&rsquo;ll do it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Also, according to the Hebrew Wikipedia, Xubuntu is pronounced as &ldquo;Zoo-boon-too&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;Ksoo-boon-too&rdquo; (its name is written in Hebrew, which solves that ambiguity).</p>
<p>Therefore, when I told a friend that my old computer would not boot because of a hard disk problem, and all the technicians advised me to buy a new one, but I installed Xubuntu and it works, he noted that &ldquo;Xubuntu&rdquo; actually sounds like &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not doing that, I&rsquo;m moving to Linux!&rdquo;</p>

         Introducing the Xubuntu Council

   </ul>

   <p>At the beginning of 2016 the Xubuntu team started a process to transition the project to become council-run rather than having a single project leader. After careful planning, writing and approving the general direction, the team was ready to vote on for the first three members of the council for the project.</p>
<p>In this article we explain what the new Xubuntu Council is and who the council members are.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-xubuntu-council-about">What is the Xubuntu Council about?</h2>
<p>The purpose of the council is very similar to the purpose of the former Xubuntu Project Leader (XPL): to make sure the direction of the project stays stable, in adherence to the <a href="http://docs.xubuntu.org/contributors/xsd.html">Strategy Document</a> and be responsible for making long-term plans and decisions where needed.</p>
<p>The two main differences between a council and the XPL, both favoring the council approach, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The administrative and bureaucratic work of managing the project is split between several people. This means more reliability and faster response times.</li>
<li>A council, with a diversity of views, can more fairly evaluate and arbitrate disputes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the council will stay more in the background in terms of daily decisions, the council does not have a casting or veto vote in the same way that the XPL had. We believe this lets us embrace the expertise in the team even more than we did before. The council also acts as a fallback to avoid deadlocks that a single point of failure like &ldquo;an XPL gone missing&rdquo; could produce.</p>
<p>If you wish to learn more about the council, you can read about it in the <a href="http://docs.xubuntu.org/contributors/xsd.html#xsd-community">Xubuntu Council section of our contributor documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-in-the-council">Who is in the Council?</h2>
<p>On August 31st, Simon Steinbeiß <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/xubuntu-devel/2016-August/011326.html">announced</a> the results of vote by Xubuntu project members. The first Xubuntu Council contains the following members:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sean Davis</strong> (bluesabre), the council chair and the Xubuntu Technical Lead</li>
<li><strong>Simon Steinbeiß</strong> (ochosi), the Xubuntu Artwork Lead and a former XPL</li>
<li><strong>Pasi Lallinaho</strong> (knome), the Xubuntu Website Lead and a former XPL and former Xubuntu Marketing Lead</li>
</ul>
<p>As the titles alone can tell you, the three council members all have a strong history with Xubuntu project. Today we want to go a bit deeper than just these titles, which is why we asked the council members a few quick questions so you can start to get to know them.</p>

<h3 id="what-inspired-you-to-get-involved-with-the-xubuntu-project">What inspired you to get involved with the Xubuntu project?</h3>
<p><strong>Sean:</strong> I started using Xubuntu in 2006 (when it was first released) and used it all throughout college and into my career. I started reporting bugs to the project in 2012 and contributing to the Ubuntu community later that year. My (selfish) inspiration was that I wanted to make my preferred operating system even better!</p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> When Dapper Drake saw the light of day 10 years ago (I know, it&rsquo;s incredible - it&rsquo;s been a decade!) and I started using Linux my first choice was - and this has never changed - Xfce and Ubuntu. At first I never thought I would be fit to contribute, but the warm welcome from the amazing community around these projects pulled me in.</p>
<p><strong>Pasi:</strong> When I converted to Linux from Windows for good in 2006, I started contributing to the Amarok project, my media player of choice back then. A few years later my contributions there slowed down at it felt like a natural step to start working with the operating system I was using.</p>
<h3 id="can-you-share-some-thoughts-about-the-future-of-xubuntu">Can you share some thoughts about the future of Xubuntu?</h3>
<p><strong>Sean:</strong> Xubuntu has always taken a conversative approach to the desktop. It includes simple, effective applications on top of a traditional desktop. That said, the technologies that Xubuntu is built on (GTK+, GStreamer, Xfce, and many many others) are undergoing significant changes and we&rsquo;re always looking to improve. I think we&rsquo;ll continue to see improvements that will welcome new users and please our longtime fans.</p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> Change is hard for many people, however based on a recent psych test I am &ldquo;surprisingly optimistic&rdquo; :) While Xubuntu – and this is heritage from Xfce – has a what many would call &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; approach I believe we can still improve the current experience by quite a bit. I don&rsquo;t mean this change has to be radical, but it should be more than just &ldquo;repainting the walls&rdquo;. This is why I personally welcome the changes in GTK+ and why I believe our future is bright.</p>
<p><strong>Pasi:</strong> As Sean mentioned, we will be seeing changes in Xubuntu in consequence of the underlying technologies and components – whether we like them or not. To be able to be part of the decision making and that Xubuntu can and will feel as integrated and polished as it does now, it&rsquo;s important to keep involved with the migration work. While this will mean less resources to put into Xubuntu-specific work in the near future, I believe it leads us into a better place later.</p>
<h3 id="so-that-people-can-get-to-know-you-a-bit-better-is-there-an-interesting-fact-about-yourself-that-you-wish-to-share">So that people can get to know you a bit better, is there an interesting fact about yourself that you wish to share?</h3>
<p><strong>Sean:</strong> Two unrelated things: I&rsquo;m also an Xfce developer and one of my current life goals is to visit Japan (and maybe one day live there).</p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> My background is a bit atypical: my two majors at University were Philosophy and Comparitive Religious Studies.</p>
<p><strong>Pasi:</strong> In addition to contributing to open source, I use my free time to play modern board games. I have about 75 of them in my office closet.</p>
<h2 id="further-questions">Further questions?</h2>
<p>If you have any questions about the council, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to ask! You can contact us by joining the IRC channel #xubuntu-devel on freenode or by joining the <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/xubuntu-devel">Xubuntu-devel mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, if this sparked your interest to get involved, be in touch with anybody from the Xubuntu team. There are a lot of things to do and all kinds of skills are useful. Maybe someday you might even become a Xubuntu Council member!</p>

   </ul>

   <p>During 2016, the Xubuntu website team has been working on integrating the releases better to the website. What this essentially means is that the maintenance is easier for the team in the future, but also that the release information is presented in a more concise and central way for each release.</p>
<h2 id="release-pages">Release pages</h2>
<p>We finally have a one-stop page for all currently supported releases – the <a href="https://xubuntu.org/releases/">Releases</a> landing page. You can find the page at any time under the <em>About</em> menu. From this page, you can easily access individual release pages.</p>
<p>The new individual release pages (for example, see the <a href="http://xubuntu.org/release/16-04/">16.04 release page</a>) lists the basic information for the release, appropriate release links (downloads and documentation), all articles on the release as well as the press links and finally, all screenshots related to the release.</p>
<p>We hope our users find the new release pages useful – we definitely do!</p>
<h2 id="automatized-links">Automatized links</h2>
<p>In addition to the release pages, we&rsquo;ve worked how some of the common links are stored internally. With these changes, we&rsquo;re able to build dynamic link lists for the <a href="https://xubuntu.org/getxubuntu/">downloads</a>, the <a href="https://xubuntu.org/press/">press links</a> (including the <a href="https://xubuntu.org/press/archive/">press archive</a>) as well as the <a href="https://xubuntu.org/help/">documentation links</a> for supported releases.</p>
<p>These changes help with the maintenance and we hope to put the time freed from running the maintenance routines into finding more useful content for the press links and improving the site content otherwise.</p>

         Presenting the Xubuntu status tracker
      </a>
   </h1>

   <ul class="meta">
      
      
      <li><time datetime="2016-11-01T10:43:21&#43;00:00">November 1, 2016</time></li>
      
      
   </ul>

   <p>Status tracking is useful for all kinds of projects, including Xubuntu. Amongst other things, it allows contributors to quickly see what&rsquo;s left to do and what others are working on. When the tracking data is kept up to date, the resulting data can be immensely helpful.</p>
<p>Until 2015, the Xubuntu team had been using the common status tracker for Ubuntu teams. For a reason or another, it suddenly stopped working as tracking data from Launchpad didn&rsquo;t make it into the tracker database. That was unfortunate, but on the other hand, it helped the team make an important decision which had been floating around for quite some time already; we need our own status tracker that is ideally better than the common one used this far.</p>
<p>Today, we want to present you the Xubuntu status tracker. For the impatient, head down to <a href="http://dev.xubuntu.org/">dev.xubuntu.org</a> to see what it looks like.</p>
<p>For the rest of us (and the impatient when they come back), continue reading to get an idea what the tracker can do and how it can help the Xubuntu team – and potentially, motivate people to start contributing to Xubuntu.</p>
<h2 id="the-views-and-the-benefits">The views and the benefits</h2>
<p>In the current state, the status tracker has four main views. The first one of them is <a href="http://dev.xubuntu.org/#tab-overview">the overview</a>, which lets contributors see how different specifications are coming along. This view also allows the visitor to look at the whiteboards of each specification easily and quickly without visiting Launchpad.</p>
<p>The other view is all about the <a href="http://dev.xubuntu.org/#tab-details">work items and their details</a>. In this view, you can filter the work items with various filters, as well as sort them by assignee, work item status or specification. The filtering is a new feature specifically built for the Xubuntu status tracker and has already proven useful for the team members.</p>
<p>For example, if you wanted to see all work items related to GTK, you could simply type <em>gtk</em> in the Text filter – the results are shown to you immediately. If you further wanted to filter the results, you could select any assignees, specifications and statuses. Yes, that&rsquo;s right, you can select multiple values for all of the filters.</p>
<p>As another example that has a more useful real world use case, you could show only all of the open work items by selecting <em>To Do</em>, <em>In Progress</em> and <em>Blocked</em> from the <em>Status</em> dropdown. Finally, you can create a handy shortcut for this view by dragging the <em>Permalink</em> into your bookmarks. Following this link you can always get to the same filter state.</p>
<p>The third view is the <a href="http://dev.xubuntu.org/#tab-burndown">burndown chart</a>. This view shows the history for the work item statuses. In the Xubuntu status tracker, the burndown chart also shows <em>events</em> that the team considers important during the cycle, mostly different freezes.</p>
<p>In addition to showing the team whether we are in good pace to finish all work items in time, it can also point out useful and interesting information for the testers and end users; for example, the amount of work items closed between Beta 1 and 2 is huge. While this means that the quality of the product should have gone up, it also means that tests ran against Beta 1 do not have any validity during the Beta 2 testing – it all needs to be ran again to make sure the fixes are actually working and that there are no regressions.</p>
<p>The final view – the <a href="http://dev.xubuntu.org/#tab-timeline">timeline</a> – simply shows which work items have been completed and when. This is also a new feature for the new tracker. The timeline is useful for the testers – when they can see what has been changed and when, they&rsquo;ll know what they need to test. It also helps the contributors to gather the release notes for the releases, especially the milestones, which has previously been laborious work digging through changelogs and much more.</p>
<p>Finally, it serves as an automatic team updates chart for the team itself as well as other teams. This way we can let everybody know what we have been working on without actively needing to take extra effort.</p>
<p>In addition to the main views, the tracker has an menu that is integrated with the Xubuntu wiki and additionally links to the team calendar, IRC channel, mailing list and the new contributor documentation.</p>
<h2 id="the-future">The future</h2>
<p>As the common Ubuntu status tracker, the Xubuntu status tracker gets most of the data from Launchpad blueprints. While this means we don&rsquo;t have to take on some of the maintaining burden, it has it&rsquo;s problems. It&rsquo;s possible that we start storing the work items internally to avoid a lot of API calls and the caching issues related with them.</p>
<p>There are also some plans for the future to start digging more information to the tracker from other tools like the QA trackers and Jenkins to get an overview of how the quality assurance is running.</p>
<p>If you are interested in contributing to the tracker, be in touch with us via the developer IRC channel (#xubuntu-devel on Freenode) or the <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/xubuntu-devel">Xubuntu developer mailing list</a>.</p>

   <p>The Xubuntu team is pleased to announce the immediate release of Xubuntu 16.10. Xubuntu 16.10 is a normal release and will be supported for 9 months.</p>
<p>This release has seen little visible change since April&rsquo;s 16.04, however much has been done towards supplying Xubuntu with Xfce packages built with GTK3, including the porting of many plugins and Xfce Terminal to GTK3. Those GTK3 ports can, if one wishes to test them, be installed from one of the team&rsquo;s <a href="https://launchpad.net/~xubuntu-dev/+archive/ubuntu/xfce4-gtk3?">development PPAs</a></p>
<p>The <strong>final release images</strong> are available as Torrents and direct downloads from <a href="http://xubuntu.org/getxubuntu/">http://xubuntu.org/getxubuntu/</a></p>
<p>As the main server will be very busy in the first few days after release, we recommend using the Torrents wherever possible.</p>

   </ul>

   <p>When we <a href="https://xubuntu.org/news/xubuntu-16-04-release/">announced</a> the release of Xubuntu 16.04 back in April there were a few known issues, but none has been more frustrating to users than this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When returning from lock, the cursor disappears on the desktop, you can bring the cursor back with Ctrl+Alt+F1 followed by Ctrl+Alt+F7</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of the other bugs were fixed by the time 16.04.1 was released in July, but this one lingered while developers tested the <code>xserver-xorg-video-intel</code> package that had the fix in the proposed repository in August.</p>
<p>Thanks to the work of those developers and the members of our community who tested the package <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/xubuntu-devel/2016-August/011279.html">upon our request</a> in August, we&rsquo;re delighted to announce that the fix has been included as a Stable Release Update (SRU)!</p>
<p>This update will be applied to your system with all other regular updates, no special action is needed on your part.</p>

<p>While we originally announced that we would be picking 6 winners, we eventually decided to pick a total of 10 winners. With many wallpapers tied on votes, we preferred to have more winners rather than trying to cut down the number to 6 exactly.</p>

   <p><em>In this series the Xubuntu team present some of the smaller details in Xubuntu to help you use your system more efficiently. Several of the features covered in this series are new for those who will be upgrading from 14.04 LTS to 16.04 LTS. We will also cover some features that have been in Xubuntu for longer, for those that are completely new to the operating system.</em></p>
<p>We have talked about customizing in this series before, but now we take a look at another aspect of it – wallpapers. Many people use personal ones, many just use whatever the default is. Some people don&rsquo;t like them at all and change to solid or gradient colors. Let&rsquo;s have a look at what you can do with them in Xubuntu.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got the new 16.04 LTS release then you will have close to 20 wallpapers, including the new community wallpaper selection.</p>
<h2 id="applying-different-wallpapers-per-workspace">Applying different wallpapers per workspace</h2>
<p>One of the easiest thing to accomplish is to have seperate wallpapers on your workspaces, so let&rsquo;s assume for a moment that you have enabled more workspaces. Go to <strong>Settings Manager → Desktop</strong> and from the <strong>Background</strong> tab, disable <strong>Apply to all workspaces</strong>. After that you can set the wallpaper for each wallpaper by moving the dialog to each workspace and picking a wallpaper as you normally would.</p>
<h2 id="enabling-automatically-changing-wallpapers">Enabling automatically changing wallpapers</h2>
<p>If you want, you can set the wallpaper to change automatically. To do this, enable <strong>Change the background</strong> in the dialog. After that you can tweak the settings: how often you want the change to happen, from somewhere in seconds &hellip; to daily. If you use the <strong>chronological</strong> option it will use all of the wallpapers you have in the selected folder split equally through the day. You can even set it to change <strong>at startup</strong> only. Finally, you can use the <strong>Random Order</strong> option to get it all mixed up!</p>
<h2 id="disabling-wallpapers">Disabling wallpapers</h2>
<p>If you want to use a single color on your desktop instead, set the <strong>Style</strong> to <strong>none</strong>. You&rsquo;ll see the wallpapers become disabled. Now you can simply choose your <strong>Color</strong> and it will apply across the whole desktop. You can also use a <strong>horizontal</strong> or <strong>vertical gradient</strong>. Once you have enabled either of these options from the dropdown you will get to choose two colors.</p>

<p>In the concluding article of this series, we will go through alternative media managers and audio players found in the Ubuntu repositories along with some comments from their contributors and users. In the second part of the article, we briefly cover some less used alternatives as well as some other topics related to media.</p>
<h2 id="more-media-managers">More media managers</h2>
<h3 id="amarok">Amarok</h3>
<p>Amarok is a powerful media manager that integrates well with web services like Last.fm, Magnatune and more. Amarok comes with many features, like support for community-developed scripts, dynamic playlists, context views and more.</p>
<p><strong>Amarok contributor:</strong> The people who love Amarok are those who want to dig more deeply into their music; they want to know about the artists, want to rate and tag their music, and have statistics about their listening habits. Amarok users want to be able to stream music as well as listen to their collection on disk.</p>
<p>Read more on the <a href="https://amarok.kde.org/">Amarok website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Amarok uses the Qt toolkit and will pull, relatively, many dependencies when installed on Xubuntu. Installing Amarok on a clean Xubuntu installation will use about 500Mb of additional disk space.</p>
<h3 id="audacious">Audacious</h3>
<p>Audacious is an audio player based on XMMS. Like its predecessor, it&rsquo;s designed to be light but configurable and supports Winamp skins. It is extendable through plugins.</p>

<p>Tomahawk is a music player that plays and manages not only your local collection, but also streams from SoundCloud, Spotify, YouTube, Google Play Music, Amazon Music, music lockers and many more. You can even connect Tomahawk with your friends via Jabber, Google Talk or Tomahawk’s new online community, <a href="http://hatchet.is/">Hatchet</a>, to share your tastes, playlists and collection.</p>
<p><strong>Tomahawk contributor:</strong> Tomahawk is basically a music metadata player. In short, given the name of a song and artist Tomahawk will find the right source based on the users available streaming music services and collections. This fundamentally different approach to music enables a range of new music consumption and sharing experiences previously not possible.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Tomahawk uses the Qt toolkit and will pull, relatively, many dependencies when installed on Xubuntu. Installing Tomahawk on a clean Xubuntu installation will use about 260 Mb of additional disk space.</p>

<p>In 2015, the Xubuntu team created and introduced the Xfce4 Panel Switch, a tool that allows you to work efficiently with panel layouts. The tool allows you to either choose from presets available, and create and backup your own. Let&rsquo;s have a look!</p>
<h2 id="switching-panel-layouts">Switching panel layouts</h2>
<p>Xfce4 Panel Switch is an intuitively simple tool to use. Simply select one of the presets and press <strong>Apply Configuration</strong> (first button from the left) to immediately start using the new layout. On the default installation, you can choose from Xubuntu Classic, Xubuntu Modern, Xfce 4.12, GNOME2 or Redmond.</p>
<h2 id="saving-exporting-and-importing">Saving, exporting and importing</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re someone who prefers to create a completely customized layout, the tool has something for you as well. To put the tool to the test, why not create a new panel setup?</p>
<p>To edit panel preferences, go to <strong>Settings Manager → Panel</strong> and from the opening dialog, add and remove panels and change panel settings as you like. You can even change its orientation or even have it as a Deskbar so you can move it about the desktop.</p>
<p>When you are ready, go back to the panel switcher and press <strong>Save Configuration</strong> to save the setup. You can now switch between your newly created layout and the presets whenever you want.</p>
<p>Finally, you can use the <strong>Export</strong> and <strong>Import</strong> options to move your layouts to and use them on any machine with the tool installed.</p>

   <p><em>Xubuntu 16.04 LTS will be the first Xubuntu release without a default media manager. To help those without a favorite one, we&rsquo;ve put up this series where some of the Xubuntu team members talk about their favorite media managers. Later in the series we discuss some cloud services and other media manager options in the Ubuntu repositories. Enjoy!</em></p>
<p>In addition to the more traditional media managers which manage local collections, more and more people use cloud based streaming services. In this article, we talk about the cloud services and players used by the Xubuntu team.</p>
<h2 id="google-play-music">Google Play Music</h2>
<p>Google Play Music is available widely in the world, coverage areas including most of the Americas, Europe, Australia and more. You can use Google Play Music for free, but paid subscription options are available. Their song catalogue covers 35 million songs.</p>
<p><strong>David:</strong> I mainly listen to music locally, CDs and vinyls. At work I usually use Google Play Music. Apart from their huge catalogue, there&rsquo;s also the possibility of uploading up to 50000 songs, using the <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/1075570?hl=en">Google Play Music Manager API</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Elizabeth:</strong> I also listen to a lot of music locally, typically MP3s I&rsquo;ve bought or created from CDs. However, I also have a monthly subscription to Google Play Music for the latest music I don&rsquo;t feel compelled to buy directly. I&rsquo;m using the web-based player in Google Chrome on Xubuntu, but it also seamlessly integrates with all my Android devices (including my watch!) via the Android apps.</p>
<h2 id="pandora">Pandora</h2>
<p>Pandora is available in Australia, New Zealand and the United States only. Their song catalogue is between one and two million songs.</p>
<p>The easiest way to use Pandora on Xubuntu is the web interface at pandora.com. For those seeking tighter or geekier (read: more fun) integration with the desktop, there are unofficial GTK+ and terminal clients available. The GTK+ client, <a href="https://pithos.github.io/">Pithos</a>, includes sound indicator and notification support. The terminal client, <a href="https://github.com/PromyLOPh/pianobar">pianobar</a>, allows station management and playback, as well as keybinding support. Both clients are available in the Ubuntu repositories.</p>
<p><strong>Sean:</strong> I stream all of my music. I have a small music library from when I was younger, but became bored with my own lack of variety. While I occasionally use Spotify, I almost always stream Pandora, switching between the web interface, Android application, and the Pithos GTK+ client. If I&rsquo;ve got music playing, it&rsquo;s coming from one of my 50+ Pandora stations.</p>
<h2 id="spotify">Spotify</h2>
<p>Spotify is available widely in the world, coverage areas including most of the Americas, Europe and Australia. You can use Spotify for free, but paid subscription options are available. Their song catalogue covers about 30 million songs.</p>
<p>Currently, the easiest way to use Spotify on Xubuntu is the web interface at play.spotify.com. Playing and browsing works well with the web interface, but if you want desktop integration (sound indicator and notifications), you will have to install the desktop client. The desktop client isn&rsquo;t available from the Ubuntu repositories directly, but Spotify offers their own repository and instructions on setting the desktop app up at the <a href="https://www.spotify.com/download/linux/">Spotify website</a>. <strong>Please note:</strong> The desktop client is unsupported by Spotify. Since it&rsquo;s closed source, it is also unsupported by the Xubuntu team. That said, our experience says it works well for most of the people and is totally worth trying if you want to use Spotify with desktop integration.</p>
<p><strong>Pasi:</strong> While I mostly listen to music locally, I occasionally use Spotify to listen to new music that I want to try before I buy. For this purpose the web interface is more than good enough – the collection is also large enough to find most of the things I&rsquo;m looking for.</p>

<h2 id="adding-your-personal-information">Adding your personal information</h2>
<p>To run Mugshot, go to <strong>Settings Manager → About Me</strong>. To add your personal information, simply fill in the form.</p>
<p>The first installed user and any added admin users will be able to change any field. Normal users can change their image and most of the fields, this type of user will not be able to change phone numbers.</p>
<p>To add a user image, click on the placeholder image on the left side of the dialog and select your preferred user image. If you have a webcam connected, you can use it to take a photo of yourself to use.</p>

<p>Customization is one of the strengths of Xubuntu and Xfce alike. Along with the customization options and sensible default settings, the Xubuntu team is committed to shipping some alternatives where appropriate.</p>
<p>Today we take a look at two color schemes Xubuntu provides for the Mousepad text editor and the Xfce4 terminal emulator: <em>Xubuntu Light</em> and <em>Xubuntu Dark</em>. As the names imply, these are themes with light and dark backgrounds. The rest of the color schemes are designed to visually integrate with each other – and with the rest of the operating system.</p>

<p>Last time we talked about the default, application shortcut keys in Xubuntu. In addition to the application shortcut keys, you can specify shortcuts for window manager actions and a special key to grab and move windows more quickly. Let&rsquo;s take a look how to do that!</p>
<h2 id="window-manager-shortcuts">Window manager shortcuts</h2>
<p>The window manager shortcuts let you perform all kinds of actions for windows, including cycling windows, resizing them and showing the desktop. Some of the most useful are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alt+Tab</strong> for cycling and changing windows (<strong>Shift+Alt+Tab</strong> for cycling backwards)</li>
<li><strong>Super+Tab</strong> for cycling windows for the same application</li>
<li><strong>Alt+F5</strong> for maximizing windows horizontally</li>
<li><strong>Alt+F6</strong> for maximizing windows vertically</li>
<li><strong>Alt+F7</strong> for maximizing windows (both vertically and horizontally)</li>
<li><strong>Alt+Space</strong> for the window operations menu</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find and edit all window manager shortcut keys from <strong>Menu <strong>→</strong> Settings Manager <strong>→</strong> Window Manager → tab Keyboard</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-grab-and-move-key">The grab and move key</h2>
<p>Xfce uses a special key that helps you grab and move windows. By default, this key is <strong>Alt</strong>.</p>
<p>When you <em>press the key and drag the window with the left mouse button</em>, you can move the window. When you <em>press the key and drag the window from a corner with the right mouse button</em>, you can resize the window.</p>
<p>To change the grab and move key, go to <strong>Menu → Settings Manager → Window Manager Tweaks → tab Accessibility</strong> and change the <strong>Key used to grab and move windows</strong> setting.</p>

   <p><em>Xubuntu 16.04 LTS will be the first Xubuntu release without a default media manager. To help those without a favorite one, we&rsquo;ve put up this series where some of the Xubuntu team members talk about their favorite media managers. Later in the series we discuss some cloud services and other media manager options in the Ubuntu repositories. Enjoy!</em></p>
<p>This time we&rsquo;re covering the latest (and for now, the last) default media manager in Xubuntu – gmusicbrowser. In addition to using gmusicbrowser, both of the interviewees have been working with gmusicbrowser – and were the ones that convinced others to include it as the default media manager in Xubuntu in the first place. Let&rsquo;s see what they have to say!</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-listen-to-music">How do you listen to music?</h2>
<p><strong>Pasi:</strong> My collection is relatively large (6k+ tracks), considering I own most of the albums physically. I like my music to be organized well and with lots of metadata so I can quickly search and browse the collection and get to listen to what I want.</p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> I&rsquo;ve been using gmusicbrowser for listening to and – almost more importantly – organizing my music for several years. Even though I&rsquo;ve recently been drifting towards mobile usage it is still my go-to solution on laptops and desktops.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-gmusicbrowser-the-best-choice-for-you">Why is gmusicbrowser the best choice for you?</h2>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> I was long looking for a solid, Gtk+ based music collection organizer which would work reasonably well on old hardware when I found gmusicbrowser. It was part of my entry into the Open Source world, so I&rsquo;m also emotionally attached to it.</p>
<p>What attracted me in the first place was the performance (yeah, I know, it&rsquo;s Perl! ;)) and the easy way of customizing the User Interface using its unique UI scripting language.</p>
<p><strong>Pasi:</strong> The best thing in gmusicbrowser is the customizability; both for the look and feel but also for the potential it has to organize your music in a dozen ways. As I mentioned before, I like lots of metadata. My music isn&rsquo;t only organized by artist, album, year (and other generic fields), but also by country of origin, language of the vocals, original artist, media format (CD, CDEP, CD single, 7&quot; vinyl&hellip;) and more. The reason why this is particularly accessible is that you can search from the tags with Google-like syntax in gmusicbrowser; for example, &ldquo;year:2015&rdquo; shows me all of the tracks from the year 2015, and &ldquo;vocals:instr&rdquo; shows me all the instrumental tracks in my collection (and &ldquo;year:2015 vocals:instr&rdquo; all the instrumental tracks from 2015&hellip;)!</p>
<p>Another thing I prefer in apps generally is that they keep on the background when I&rsquo;m not dealing with them. The Shimmer layout for gmusicbrowser does exactly this: it loses many of the unnecessary buttons, making the user interface clean, but isn&rsquo;t dumbed down; there&rsquo;s still plenty of things available within a few clicks when I do need to access those features.</p>
<h2 id="have-you-customized-gmusicbrowser">Have you customized gmusicbrowser?</h2>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> Naturally! I&rsquo;ve worked on creating the layout (&ldquo;Shimmer Desktop&rdquo;) which went on to become the default in Xubuntu – a story which went on for several years in fact. Plus I developed a plugin for gmusicbrowser (&ldquo;Similar Artists&rdquo;) using the API of last.fm to create potentially endless automatic playlists based on &ldquo;similar artist&rdquo; matches.</p>
<p><strong>Pasi:</strong> Yes, a lot. In addition to co-working on the Shimmer layout mentioned by Simon, the extra tags I mentioned before are created with the custom field UI in gmusicbrowser. I have also tweaked the main view to show more of the metadata when browsing through the collection. This saves me time because I don&rsquo;t have to access another view – or the physical album.</p>
<h2 id="have-you-used-other-media-managers-in-the-past">Have you used other media managers in the past?</h2>
<p><strong>Pasi:</strong> During the time I&rsquo;ve been using Linux exclusively, the two other media managers I&rsquo;ve used for a longer time are Amarok and Listen.</p>
<p>In 2006 when I converted to Linux, I started using Amarok and got involved with their marketing team &ldquo;Rokymotion&rdquo; – my work with the team included working on artwork and more, including one splash screen for a release. I was (and am) convinced that the 1.4 series of Amarok was the best media manager of its time; when work on 2.0 began, I drifted away since the new UI with all the bling wasn&rsquo;t my cup of tea.</p>
<p>One thing I actually still miss from Amarok is the &ldquo;random albums&rdquo; mode, where skipping a track would always skip to the first track of another random album. This album would then be played until all of the tracks were played from that album, or the user skipped a track once again.</p>
<p>While Amarok was a full-fledged media manager, Listen was something from the lighter end of the bunch. I even used the compact UI with only the basic playback buttons and a simple list of all the tracks (at that time, likely 4–5 thousand). I liked how it definitely help me focus on the music, nothing else. However, I do consider that Listen was as an intermediary manager – a kind of compromise – until I found the next complete media manager I wanted to use. Unfortunately, it seems like the project hasn&rsquo;t been active for several years now, so it likely isn&rsquo;t something to look for.</p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> I have. I started with xine and later Parole, then several Winamp-style players, but always missed the &ldquo;collection management&rdquo; part that gmusicbrowser does so well.</p>
<h2 id="is-there-something-else-you-would-like-to-share-with-us">Is there something else you would like to share with us?</h2>
<p><strong>Pasi:</strong> As with all application groups and the operating systems, it&rsquo;s important to remember that objectively speaking, there is no &ldquo;best&rdquo; option. This is why I can only recommend that you try gmusicbrowser, not promise you will love it! Finally, remember that all applications have their quirks (and bugs!) – gmusicbrowser too. Once you get over the initial hurdles, you will notice that there is a powerful, customizable media manager behind the potentially confusing first look.</p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> I would say gmusicbrowser is a player for (almost) anyone. While it seems to have a bit of a learning curve for the occasional user – and I would argue that the complexity implied by &ldquo;collection management&rdquo; is responsible for that – it has immense potential for the afficionado!</p>
<h2 id="finally-feel-free-to-talk-about-your-favorite-artists">Finally, feel free to talk about your favorite artists!</h2>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> I can&rsquo;t say that I have a favorite artist. Probably I could list one per genre, but then again, what or where are genre borders really? Recently I have to developed some affection for some of Chilly Gonzales&rsquo; musical (ad)ventures, but as everything this may be a transient phenomenon.</p>
<p><strong>Pasi:</strong> I seem to have a soft spot for some britpop; Athlete, Starsailor and Thirteen Senses are three of my favorite artists! Generally speaking I do listen to pretty much everything and anything – at least once.</p>

<p>Xubuntu comes with some useful shortcut keys by default. Using these shortcut keys can help you be more efficient with your daily work. Of course you can always modify them or add your own. Here&rsquo;s how!</p>
<h2 id="default-shortcuts">Default shortcuts</h2>
<p>For convenience, some default application can be launched with shortcuts that use the Super key (usually the &ldquo;Windows&rdquo; key) and a letter associated with the task (underlined):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Super+E</strong> for the text <strong>e</strong>ditor (Mousepad)</li>
<li><strong>Super+F</strong> for the <strong>f</strong>ile manager (Thunar)</li>
<li><strong>Super+M</strong> for the e<strong>m</strong>ail client (Thunderbird)</li>
<li><strong>Super+T</strong> for the <strong>t</strong>erminal emulator (Xfce4 Terminal)</li>
<li><strong>Super+W</strong> for the <strong>w</strong>eb browser (Firefox)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find all the application shortcut keys from <strong>Menu → Settings Manager → Keyboard → tab Application Shortcuts</strong>. You can also easily <strong>Add</strong> new shortcuts from this dialog.</p>

<p>The application menus offer access to all installed applications on the system, whether it was shipped by default or installed a minute ago. While the applications are organized by category, there are situations where you want to reorganize them to your liking. Alternatively, you might want to hide a launcher completely or create a new one for your own custom script.</p>
<p>MenuLibre is an application created for that purpose by the Xubuntu team. Let&rsquo;s see how you can get started with menu editing!</p>
<h2 id="hiding-moving-and-adding-launchers">Hiding, moving and adding launchers</h2>
<p>To open MenuLibre, go to <strong>Menu → Settings Manager → Menu Editor</strong> <em>or</em> right-click the menu and select <strong>Edit Applications</strong>.</p>
<p>Hiding launchers is one of the simplest ways to change the way your menu looks. To hide a launcher, search for the application you wish to hide from the <strong>search box in the top right corner</strong>, then click the launcher you want to edit in the <strong>left sidebar</strong>. After that, click the <strong>Hide from menus</strong> button under the <strong>Options</strong> section, then <strong>Save Launcher</strong> (second button from the left in the toolbar).</p>
<p>If you want to move a launcher inside a menu, find it in the tree pane, then use the arrow buttons below to move it. You don&rsquo;t have to save changes – moving menu items happens real time.</p>
<p>Adding launchers is slightly more complicated, but only because there are more steps to take. To add a launcher, first press the <strong>Add</strong> button (with the plus sign, first from the left on the toolbar) and from the opening menu, select <strong>Add Launcher</strong>, type the <strong>Command</strong> you want the launcher to run. You&rsquo;ll likely also want to change at least the <strong>Icon</strong> (change by clicking the icon) and <strong>Name</strong>. Finally, feel free to change other options as you wish and then press <strong>Save Launcher</strong>.</p>
<p>The MenuLibre documentation is available online at <a href="https://smdavis.us/doku/doku.php?id=menulibre_usage">https://smdavis.us/doku/doku.php?id=menulibre_usage</a>.</p>

   <p><em>In this series the Xubuntu team present some of the smaller details in Xubuntu to help you use your system more efficiently. Several of the features covered in this series are new for those who will be upgrading from 14.04 LTS to 16.04 LTS. We will also cover some features that have been in Xubuntu for longer, for those that are completely new to the operating system.</em></p>
<p>Customization is one of the strengths of Xubuntu and Xfce alike. To make the user experience complete, the Xubuntu team has created a few small applications to make Xubuntu even more customizable.</p>
<p>One of the customization options that is provided in all operating systems across the board is the ability to change the theming of the user interface. However, the themes that are provided often come in specific colors only. Modifying them to use a different color manually can be a tedious task.</p>
<p>As originally highlighted in the Xubuntu 14.10 release, the Xubuntu team has created the <em>Theme configuration</em> application, with which you can change the colors of any theme on the fly, without having to modify the theme source!</p>
<h2 id="modifying-the-theme-colors">Modifying the theme colors</h2>
<p>To change the individual colors in your theme, open Theme configuration from <strong>Menu → Settings Manager → Theme Configuration</strong>. From this dialog you can change the <strong>highlight colors, panel colors and menu colors</strong> individually.</p>
<p>Simply turn the custom colors <strong>on</strong> or <strong>off</strong> as you wish and use the color picker to pick your preferred colors. Finally, press the <strong>Apply</strong> button to apply the changes. If you ever want to get back to the original colors, use the <strong>Reset</strong> button.</p>
<p>Note that some applications might need a restart even after pressing the Apply button for the changes to take effect.</p>

   <p><em>Xubuntu 16.04 LTS will be the first Xubuntu release without a default media manager. To help those without a favorite one, we&rsquo;ve put up this series where some of the Xubuntu team members talk about their favorite media managers. Later in the series we discuss some cloud services and other media manager options in the Ubuntu repositories. Enjoy!</em></p>
<p>This time we&rsquo;re covering the favorite media manager for several people working with the Quality Assurance. We&rsquo;ll leave for you to decide whether this is a coincidence or not!</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-listen-to-music">How do you listen to music?</h2>
<p><strong>Kev</strong>: Sometimes quietly, sometimes annoyingly loud :) The media manager starts up when the PC does first thing in the morning, it turns off when the PC does at night. I tend to run with half a dozen dynamic playlists.</p>
<p>My collection is about 1 terabytes, which converts to around 50,000 tracks and 4000 albums. I like the collection to be organized by artist, filetype and album.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel:</strong> Most of the time with headphones. I mostly listen to music when I want to focus and/or shut other people&rsquo;s voices out.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-clementine-the-best-choice-for-you">Why is Clementine the best choice for you?</h2>
<p><strong>Kev:</strong> It&rsquo;s hard to quantify why but, a few things I like - used it for ages, know it&rsquo;s ins and outs now. In fact I&rsquo;ve been using Clementine since more or less it&rsquo;s beginning, I was using Amarok 1.6x till that went, then found this fork of Amarok.</p>
<p>The Android controller for Clementine is also a useful addition for me.</p>
<p>Clementine has Hypnotoad&hellip;</p>
<p>All in all Clementine does what I want with the minimum of fuss – it does add some Qt packages, but what applications don&rsquo;t add something.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel:</strong> Because it is very stable and runs on all platforms on which I need it. Also, it has the rainbow cat! And I also use the Android remote sometimes.</p>
<h2 id="have-you-customized-clementine">Have you customized Clementine?</h2>
<p><strong>Kev:</strong> I&rsquo;ve customised Clementine a bit. Things like moodbar and internet sources – all turned off.</p>
<p>Basic stuff I set up are things like making sure it doesn&rsquo;t do anything <em>but</em> add a track when adding to queue – I&rsquo;ll start that when I want. And set up keyboard shortcuts – when keyboard does not have media keys.</p>
<p>More specifically I have some dynamic playlists which I use a lot, these use the genre tag. This does mean you have to make sure genre is right in the tags. As an aside I found easytag easiest to use here, given my file library is alphabetic it was a fairly quick job to set tags for them all. For one off tag edits I can do that within Clementine&rsquo;s right click track menu if I need to.</p>
<p>In addition I have a few very specific dynamic lists based on artists (or group of artists).</p>
<p><strong>Daniel:</strong> No - I use it as it comes by default.</p>
<h2 id="have-you-used-other-media-managers-in-the-past">Have you used other media managers in the past?</h2>
<p><strong>Kev:</strong> I think that I have in the last 8 years tried just about everything I could find to try - I always find myself coming back to Clementine though.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel:</strong> I have also tried just about every available player, but I like using the same player on each platform, and I could never find anything with the same usability as Clementine.</p>
<h2 id="is-there-something-else-you-would-like-to-share-with-us">Is there something else you would like to share with us?</h2>
<p><strong>Kev:</strong> I often install Audacious with its library plugin alongside Clementine. I tend to run the development version of Xubuntu from the day after the rest of you find out about the newly released version. It can be useful in my world to have an alternative – Audacious is it. It&rsquo;s a simple application but without the plugin, not really a media manager.</p>
<h2 id="finally-feel-free-to-talk-about-your-favorite-artists">Finally, feel free to talk about your favorite artists!</h2>
<p><strong>Kev:</strong> If only I was allowed too – I was asked not to rabbit on interminably about the 70s&hellip; suffice it to say that my taste in music is pretty wide-ranging – except for Country/Western and that thing loosely called Pop&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Daniel:</strong> I listen to just about every kind of kind of music. I am fairly open to most genres.</p>

<p>Recently Charles McColm and Paul Nijjar took time to write to us about their work at The Working Centre&rsquo;s Computer Recycling Project in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada where they&rsquo;re using Xubuntu. So without further ado, here&rsquo;s what they are working on, in their own words.</p>
<h2 id="please-tell-us-a-bit-about-yourself-the-working-centre-and-your-computer-recycling-project">Please tell us a bit about yourself, The Working Centre and your Computer Recycling Project</h2>
<p>The Working Centre was originally established back in the early 1980s as a response to growing unemployment and poverty in downtown Kitchener, Ontario, Canada. Joe and Stephanie Mancini saw the potential for building a community around responding to unemployment and poverty through creative and engaging action. Different projects have rose out of this vision over the years divided into six areas; the Job Search Resource Centre, St. John’s Kitchen, Community Tools, Access to Technology, Affordable Supportive Housing and the Waterloo School for Community Development.</p>

        <img src="http://localhost:1313/news/series/xubuntu-at/xubuntu-at-the-working-centres-computer-recycling-project/working_center_side_door.png"/> </figure>

<p>The Computer Recycling Project started as the result of creative thinking by an individual who had some serious obstacles to employment. The person couldn&rsquo;t work, but wanted to help others find work. So in the late 1980s the individual put together a few computers for people to create resumes on. Other people became interested in helping out and the Computer Recycling Project was born.</p>
<p>Computer Recycling and the other projects have the following qualities:</p>
<ul>
<li>They take donated or low cost materials, in our case computers and computer parts.</li>
<li>The apply volunteer labour to convert (repair/test) these materials into valuable goods. These goods are offered to the community at accessible prices (our computers generally range from $30 to $140)</li>
<li>Projects provide opportunities for people unable to work to contribute back to the community and help those looking to find jobs and upgrade their skills.</li>
<li>Projects also focus on creating open, friendly, and inclusive environments where everyone can contribute.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-influenced-your-decision-to-use-open-source-software-in-your-organization">What influenced your decision to use Open Source software in your organization?</h2>
<p>Computer Recycling didn’t always use Xubuntu and wasn’t originally a full time venture. Linux adoption started slowly. In 2001, thanks in part to our local Linux User Group, several volunteers (Paul Nijjar, Charles McColm and Daniel Allen) started working on a custom Linux distribution called Working Centre Linux Project (WCLP). At the time Computer Recycling had no legal options for distributing computers with Windows, so free and open source software was very appealing.</p>
<p>A couple of years later the project became a Microsoft Authorized Refurbisher. However restrictions on licensing (computers had to have a pre-existing Certificate of Authenticity and could only be sold to qualified low-income individuals) prevented us from installing Windows on all computers.</p>
<p>Linux didn’t have these kinds of restrictions so we continued to use it on a large number of computers. Over the years the Microsoft program changed and we became a Microsoft Registered Refurbisher (MRR). Microsoft dropped the “must have a pre-existing COA” on the computers we refurbish for low income individuals and provided another (more expensive) license for commercial sales, but we’ve continued to install both Windows and Linux. Last month Xubuntu Linux machines accounted for 63% of the computers we sold (due in part to the fact that we only sell Notebooks/Laptops with Xubuntu).</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="http://localhost:1313/news/series/xubuntu-at/xubuntu-at-the-working-centres-computer-recycling-project/working_center_systems.jpg"/> </figure>

<p>Price was definitely a factor for us in preferring open source software over other options. Most of the people we work with don’t have a lot of money, so accessing a low-cost ecosystem of reliable software was important. Each closed source license (Windows/Office) we buy costs the project money and this in turn translates into cost we have to pass on to the person buying a computer. We do a fair amount of quality assurance on systems, but if a system suffers some catastrophic failure (as we’ve had with a certain line of systems) we end up spending money on 4 licenses (2 for the original Windows/Office system and 2 for the replacement system). With Xubuntu we can often just pull the hard drive, put it in a different system and it’ll “just work” or need a little bit of work to get going. With Xubuntu the only cost to us is the effort we put into refurbishing the hardware.</p>
<p>Malware and viruses have also driven up the demand for Xubuntu systems. In the past several years we’ve seen many more people adopting Xubuntu because they’re fed up with how easy Windows systems get infected. Although centralized reliable software repositories are starting to become more popular in the proprietary software world, for years the availability and trustability of APT repositories was a big selling point.</p>
<h2 id="what-made-you-select-xubuntu-for-your-deployments">What made you select Xubuntu for your deployments?</h2>
<p>We mentioned earlier that Computer Recycling didn’t originally use Xubuntu. Instead, we started with The Working Centre Linux Project, our mix of IceWM on Debian designed to look like Windows 9x. Maintaining WCLP proved to be challenging because all 3 of the volunteers had separate jobs and a lot of other projects were starting to appear that made putting an attractive Linux desktop on donated hardware a lot easier. One of those projects was the Ubuntu project.</p>
<p>For a few years Computer Recycling adopted Ubuntu as its Linux OS of choice… right up until Ubuntu 10.10 (Unity) arrived on the scene. At this point we started looking at alternatives and we chose Xubuntu because it doesn’t make heavy demands of video processing or RAM. We also liked the fact that it had an interface that is relatively familiar to Windows users. We considered other desktop environments like LXDE, but small things matter and ease of use features like automounting USB keys tipped our choice in favour of Xubuntu.</p>

        <img src="http://localhost:1313/news/series/xubuntu-at/xubuntu-at-the-working-centres-computer-recycling-project/working_center_xubuntu_desktop.png"/> </figure>

<h2 id="can-you-tell-us-a-bit-about-your-xubuntu-setup">Can you tell us a bit about your Xubuntu setup?</h2>
<p>Paul has done all the work on our current form of installation: preseed files and some customization scripts. Computers are network booted and depending on the system we’ll install either a 32 or 64 bit version of Xubuntu with the following customizations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proprietary Flash Player</li>
<li>We show the bottom panel with an icon tray and don’t auto hide it</li>
<li>We use a customized version of the Whisker menu to show particular items</li>
<li>We include LibreOffice instead of depending on Abiword and Gnumeric</li>
<li>We include some VNC remote connection scripts so our volunteers can securely (and with the consent of the person at the other end) connect and provide remote help</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ve set VLC as the default media player instead of Parole</li>
</ul>
<p>We are very grateful for the existence of high-quality free and open source software. In addition to using it for desktop and laptop computers, we use it for information and testing (using a Debian-Live infrastructure) and for several in-house servers. About 8 years ago we hired a programmer looking for work to turn an open source eCommerce project into the point of sale software we still use today. The flexibility of open source was really important and has made a big difference when we needed to adjust to changes (merging of GST and PST in Canada to HST for example). Closed source solutions were carefully considered, but ultimately we decided to go open source because we knew we could adapt it to our needs without depending on a vendor.</p>

<p>Paul and I are also grateful for the opportunities open source afforded us. In 2005 The Working Centre hired me (Charles) to advance the Computer Recycling Project into a more regular venture. This opportunity wouldn’t have come if I hadn’t first worked with Paul as a volunteer on the Working Centre Linux Project and worked on several other open source projects (a PHP/MySQL inventory system and a SAMBA server). Around 2007 The Working Centre hired Paul to help with system administration and general IT. Since then he’s spearheaded many FLOSS projects at The Working Centre. Daniel Allen, who also worked with us on WCLP, currently works as a Software Specialist for the Science department at the University of Waterloo.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently the Communications Coordinator at FreeGeek Chicago. My job is to manage FreeGeek&rsquo;s social networks, create content and occasionally serve as photographer for their events and volunteer days. Our organization, FreeGeek Chicago has a mission to reduce e-waste and to properly recycle computer electronics. The general public and our volunteers donate their old electronics with the intention of recycle and/or re-purpose. Our volunteers seek, test and build new computers out of the working parts donated which in turn are sold to customers with the Linux system at a reduced price. Through volunteering our volunteers learn current computer building skills and open source software.</p>

<h2 id="what-influenced-your-decision-to-use-open-source-software-at-freegeek-chicago">What influenced your decision to use Open Source Software at FreeGeek Chicago?</h2>
<p>In order to use the FreeGeek name we must adhere by certain articles, one of them being using exclusively open source software. We as an organization firmly believe in the use of open source software as a main alternative to the high prices of proprietary software. Also, we understand the positive aspects of giving the user access to modify [the software] as it can lead to a better function and understanding of the software.</p>
<h2 id="what-made-you-select-xubuntu-for-your-deployments">What made you select Xubuntu for your deployments?</h2>
<p>At the time we chose Xubuntu for a variety of reasons. First of all we believed that this platform best suited the needs of our organization. We also thought that it was the most compatible with the computers that were being donated to us. Lastly, we believed that it was an easier platform to teach our volunteers. At this time we currently use two different systems distros (Ubuntu and Kubuntu).</p>

<h2 id="can-you-tell-us-a-bit-about-your-xubuntu-setup">Can you tell us a bit about your Xubuntu setup?</h2>
<p>We try to keep it as simple as we can since our computers will be going out to the sales floor or to donation. Currently, we install LibreOffice, Krita, Inkscape, VLC Player, Firefox, Chromium, GIMP among others. Installs are done by our volunteers as part of their hands-on learning education. They load the operating system from our network and use the command line to install the rest of the programs. After it is installed our Q&amp;A team certifies the installation and the computer goes to our sales floor.</p>

<h2 id="is-there-anything-else-you-wish-to-share-with-us-about-freegeek-chicago">Is there anything else you wish to share with us about FreeGeek Chicago?</h2>
<p>FreeGeek Chicago is a community organization that refurbishes used computers and parts to provide functional computers to volunteers and the general public. We provide education in practical computing, hands-on job skills training, and an outlet for community service, recycle non-reusable materials in an ethical, safe, and environmentally responsible manner.</p>

         Building the Xubuntu documentation package locally

   <p>The Xubuntu documentation, shipped with every release of Xubuntu, is in fact a package that can be built locally, on your computer.</p>
<p>By default, Xubuntu does not come with the tools required to build the documentation package, so there is the need to prepare your system to be able to do it, by installing the required prerequisite packages. To do this, run the following command:</p>
<p><code>sudo apt-get build-dep xubuntu-docs</code></p>
<p>Additionally, if you are running a release <em>earlier than 15.10</em>, you will need to install the package <code>fop</code> manually, because it&rsquo;s not yet a dependency of the package in your release. To do this, simply run:</p>
<p><code>sudo apt-get install fop</code></p>
<p>Once that&rsquo;s done, all you have to do is to get the latest main branch and build the package. Again in a terminal window, run the following commands, one at a time:</p>
<p><code>bzr branch lp:xubuntu-docs``cd xubuntu-docs``make</code> (running this command will take some time as it builds both HTML and PDF versions of the documentation in various languages) <code>exo-open --launch WebBrowser build/index.html</code></p>
<p>Now that you have the source on your system, you have the ability to edit it and ultimately, suggest improvements to the documentation. If you have any doubts about how you can contribute, just have a read on how you can assist with the Xubuntu documentation, <a href="http://xubuntu.org/contribute/documentation/">here</a>.</p>

         <li>16.04</li>
      
      
   </ul>

   <p>It is early for a post on the website from the Quality Assurance team, but we&rsquo;re just about to start testing a release that will be supported for more than the regular 9 months&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="general-testing-outlook-for-xenial">General testing outlook for Xenial</h2>
<p>During the next 26 weeks, we are going to be concentrating on the applications that we have in Xubuntu. This is a change from the last couple of cycles, where the emphasis has been more on the ISOs than the applications.</p>
<p>We will still be testing the ISOs, but mostly only during the milestones we are participating in. At the moment, these milestones are Alpha 2, and both Betas.</p>
<p>A quote from Sean Davis, the technical lead, from one of the recent Xubuntu meetings sums up what Xenial will be about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From a development perspective, we&rsquo;re targeting bug fixes to make 16.04 super stable. Don&rsquo;t expect a lot of new features, so testing done at all parts of the cycle will be incredibly relevant.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="package-tracker">Package tracker</h2>
<p>If you visit our section of the <a href="http://packages.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/milestones/350/builds/105268/testcases">Package Tracker</a> you will see that we have 3 sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Priority.</strong> These packages will be called for testing by the QA team many times during the cycle as usual. In addition you might see calls directly from developers to test a version of an application or package prior to bug fixes landing.</li>
<li><strong>Mandatory.</strong> These will also see many calls for testing, though likely less so than the Priority group. Again, calls could come from either the QA team or directly from developers.</li>
<li><strong>Run-once/optional.</strong> These are scheduled to be called for testing only once during the cycle. If bug fixes are needed, we will additionally ask testers to check that the bug fixes actually fix the bugs and do not cause regressions.</li>
</ul>
<p>From time to time we will disable applications or packages from testing when we know a fix is due to land in the near future. This has two benefits: First, testers do not need to test applications that are known to have issues. Second, a pause in the testing allows the developers to have some time to look at the issues and prepare fixes.</p>
<p>When something has been disabled we will list it on the <em>Disabled Tests</em> list of our <a href="https://trello.com/b/IV66JCHl/xubuntu-qa">QA trello site</a>.</p>
<h2 id="why-should-i-test">Why should I test?</h2>
<p>You could be the one person who gains enough momentum to report that <em>thing</em> which annoys you and possibly other people – and gain their unworded thanks.</p>
<p>As much as Xubuntu Team would love to be able to test every scenario for you – the simple truth is we can&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s why we <strong>all</strong> need you.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-know-what-to-test">How do I know what to test?</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can help. We will cover some of the most common ways below.</p>
<h3 id="running-wily-1510-without-ppas">Running Wily (15.10) without PPAs</h3>
<p>If you have installed or upgraded to 15.10 Wily Werewolf, you can help to ensure that the next release gets as much testing as possible. Practically, you are already testing for the community – you just don&rsquo;t realise it.</p>
<p>Found a bug? Don&rsquo;t ignore it – report it, it is in this scenario as simple as opening a terminal and running <code>ubuntu-bug &lt;em&gt;packagename&lt;/em&gt;</code> and letting the reporting get taken care off for you. All we ask in addition to that is you adding a specific tag to your report <strong>xubuntu-exp</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="running-wily-1510-with-ppas">Running Wily (15.10) with PPAs</h3>
<p>If you wish, you can add the development PPAs to 15.10. If you do that, we would also advise installing <em>ppa-purge</em> to help remove the PPAs cleanly. This is the situation closely mimicking our developers&rsquo; workflow. You can test the newest version of applications or packages this way.</p>
<p>Reporting bugs with PPAs becomes a little harder to accomplish&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="running-xenial-with-or-without-ppas">Running Xenial with or without PPAs</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve upgraded or clean installed Xenial, then running that at this stage <em>with</em> PPAs shouldn&rsquo;t be any braver than without. The bug reporting process is the same in Xenial as in Wily.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-you-want-me-to-look-for">What do you want me to look for?</h2>
<p>Obviously all those things that people would normally refer to as bugs need to be reported. For example, crashes when using an application. In addition, during the LTS cycle, the developers are particularly keen for you to be looking for non-critical bugs as well. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Missing icons</li>
<li>Inconsistent functionality</li>
<li>Usability bugs (see a specific example of a usability bug for <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/catfish/+bug/1508918">Catfish</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>These things will not only improve us as downstream Xubuntu but also the upstreams of Xfce and Ubuntu.</p>
<h2 id="you-have-convinced-me--what-should-i-do-now">You have convinced me – what should I do now?</h2>
<p>There are a few things you can do to make it easier for you to pass on and receive information.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you haven&rsquo;t got one, <a href="https://launchpad.net/+login">register a Launchpad account</a></li>
<li>Join the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~xubuntu-testers">Xubuntu Testers</a> team; we will send testing related information through this team</li>
<li>Join the <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/xubuntu-devel">Xubuntu developer mailing list</a> in order to talk to us easily about issues you might have while testing</li>
<li>Check what we have going on during the cycle at the <a href="http://tracker.xubuntu.org/">Xubuntu status tracker</a> and use the <em>IRC</em> tab to talk to us about helping with testing</li>
</ul>
<p>More detailed information on what is discussed above and more can be found on the current QA <a href="http://xubuntu.org/contribute/qa">contribution page</a>.</p>

<p>Many users or members of the community will know this already, but just for the sake of clarity: Xubuntu 15.10 Wily Werewolf will be the first release to ship LibreOffice by default. This has been a long-standing and often-repeated request so we decided to try and evaluate this on our way to the next LTS release, which will be 16.04.</p>
<p>Consequently, we started evaluating LibreOffice&rsquo;s integration in our Desktop Environment. While there is already a package which provides integration with the Gtk+ theme (libreoffice-gtk), we found that none of the existing icon themes really worked too well with Xubuntu&rsquo;s default theme <em>elementary-xfce</em>. Ubuntu&rsquo;s <em>human</em> theme – being the closest match because of having <em>elementary</em> on its base – has been abandoned a longer while ago and looks a bit dated (and frankly too orange for Xubuntu). Other options like <em>Tango</em> work quite well with our color scheme, but still aren&rsquo;t a perfect match.</p>
<p>So our artwork team went ahead and started working on the most prominent icons in LibreOffice Writer and Calc – the two applications shipped by default. The majority of those icons has been either ported or re-done with elementary in mind. Furthermore, over the course of the last months several icons specific to LibreOffice Impress have been tackled. The preliminary results are available for testing already and the final result will be shipped with the release of Xubuntu 15.10. We&rsquo;re also working with the LibreOffice team to get the new icon theme integrated upstream, so more distributions and users can benefit from our work.</p>

<h2 id="what-influenced-your-decision-to-use-open-source-software-at-the-school">What influenced your decision to use Open Source Software at the school?</h2>
<p>With Open Source Software I can freely use, and share to anyone. So it was big part of my decision. Now my students can have the same software without charging them. And they can practice at their home. Also there are a lots of great educational software for the learning process.</p>
<h2 id="what-made-you-select-xubuntu-specifically-for-your-lab">What made you select Xubuntu specifically for your lab?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a Ubuntu user before. My brother has been an Ubuntu user for many years! He taught me the benefits of this OS. But now, I needed an OS to be lighter, faster and user friendly for the teachers and students. Something easier to adapt to, coming from Windows. Also, because Xubuntu is an Ubuntu flavor it has all the administration, education and office software that I need at this time, for example: LibreOffice, Tux Paint, GCompris, TuxMath, Epoptes, etc.</p>
<h2 id="can-you-tell-us-a-bit-about-your-xubuntu-setup--customizations-made-how-installs-are-done-etc">Can you tell us a bit about your Xubuntu setup – customizations made, how installs are done, etc.</h2>
<p>I installed Xubuntu to 20 used computers Intel Core 2 Duo with 2GB RAM. I used a router and 3 switches to connect them to the network and to my main computer which I monitor, see and administrate each one from my master PC using Epoptes administration software. With it I can see, control or command to open any application in each students computer. (Epoptes is in the Ubuntu Software Center) We painted or classroom with blue and white (for Xubuntu colors). We drew and painted a Linux Penguin Logo in the wall! We still need to draw the mouse from the Xubuntu logo. It&rsquo;s a Xubuntu Lab!</p>

<p>Colegio Hispano Americano is a private school that uses the Cueto Method to teach children.</p>
<p>The school is scientifically arranged for the child to learn the basic skills of reading and writing in a reasoned manner, by composition. By using this method, lawyer Jose M. Cueto noticed that destroyed, sullen, self-conscious children suddenly began to respond spontaneously, smile, lost their shyness and wanted to show what they knew. When being actively involved in their own learning, children ultimately learn to reason and deduce in a reasoned manner.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we use the Python Whiteboard in the software repositories. We use it to connect a Nintendo Wiimote to the PC via Bluetooth. This has allowed us to create a Digital Whiteboard with out buying one.</p>
<p>Materials needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Xubuntu on a Bluetooth capable computer</li>
<li>Python Whiteboard software to setup the Wiimote via Bluetooth (package python-whiteboard)</li>
<li><a href="http://open-sankore.org/">Open Sankoré</a> as the whiteboard software</li>
<li>Infrared Pen (buy for $20.00 or less or make one by yourself)</li>
<li>Nintendo Wiimote</li>
<li>Projector</li>
</ul>
<p>Last year I used the above setup with Xubuntu in my class. It is excellent for learning process; on the whiteboard we can write, use pictures, games and more. The following is a video of it in use: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1XzGk43njc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1XzGk43njc</a> (in Spanish).</p>
<p>If anyone from Puerto Rico wants to know more about Cueto Method or to how build a low cost Xubuntu Computer Lab, feel free to contact us by phone: 1-787-884-0276 (school phone number) or me 1-787-201-1750. I am also available via email at torres_jose10 at hotmail dot com.</p>

   <p><em>The Xubuntu team hears stories about how it is used in organizations all over the world. In this &ldquo;Xubuntu at..&rdquo; series of interviews, we seek to interview organizations who wish to share their stories.

<p>Last month we started a dialog with Kevin Driscoll, PC/Linux Technical Consultant, and Dave Sevick, Executive Director, of Computer Reach to learn more about how they&rsquo;re using Xubuntu in their organization. The following is an exchange we had with Kevin over email, huge thanks to him for taking the time to share details about their work with us.</p>

<p>Computer Reach is a volunteer organization in Pittsburgh that refurbishes computers for use by non-profits. Local companies, school districts, and individuals donate their used computers to us. We recondition them and use imaging software to put standardized software on them, mainly for educational use. The operation started in 2001 doing just Macs but for the past several years has a strong PC-Linux operation. More about Computer Reach at <a href="http://www.computerreach.org/">computerreach.org</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-influenced-your-decision-to-use-open-source-software-in-your-organization">What influenced your decision to use Open Source Software in your organization?</h2>
<p>The cost and complexity of licensed software made open source software the only real solution for us. Funding is low and the price point for new equipment keeps falling, making it more challenging to sell (or fund) used computers. LibreOffice and Linux are the main open source software that we use, but it is the core of what makes us an educational operation as well. Our volunteers are not always technically capable. Learning how to use software is key to attracting in new volunteers. Since they can freely download and use any of the open source software that they learn to work with while helping Computer Reach, it is a great enabler for them. As a further benefit, the fact that volunteers that come to help improve their own capabilities and thus their work situation helps us raise funds from those willing to underwrite community education and career development.</p>
<h2 id="what-made-you-select-xubuntu-for-your-pc-deployments">What made you select Xubuntu for your PC deployments?</h2>
<p>Initially, Edubuntu was the Linux distribution that was used because of bountiful online resources and the included array of software for school-age children. More recently, in order to be able to run similarly on computers from 5-15 years old, we had to choose a desktop environment that was intuitive but also light-weight. Xfce was the environment I thought lent itself best to efficiency as well as features. We have used it to put together a desktop that is equally intuitive to Mac users as it is to Windows users, since most users of our computers are coming to Linux from one of those platforms.</p>

<h2 id="can-you-tell-us-a-bit-about-your-xubuntu-setup">Can you tell us a bit about your Xubuntu setup?</h2>
<p>We have three images which help us cover PC&rsquo;s as old as 15 years. Most of our computers are 5-10 years old and run what we call &ldquo;32x&rdquo; (32-bit Xubuntu). Computers with 64-bit processors and more than 2GB RAM get &ldquo;64x&rdquo; (64-bit Xubuntu), while older computers get &ldquo;32Lite.&rdquo; Both 32x and 64x are based on Xubuntu 14.04 LTS so we can expect updates through early 2019. (Ed. Only packages shared with Ubuntu will receive updates, Xfce and other components are only supported until 2017.) &ldquo;32Lite&rdquo; is based on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS since it is the last version with clear support for non-PAE motherboards often present in older systems.</p>
<p>All of the systems use the Whisker Menu and a panel to launch common apps. LibreOffice and the Educational Desktop are on all systems as well. We put Wikipedia for Schools (offline) on the &ldquo;x&rdquo; versions so users without internet access can still used that offline version like an encyclopedia. (It is not on the &ldquo;Lite&rdquo; version so the system can run on machines with as small as 10GB hard drives).</p>
<p>We create a supervisory user account, a standard one, and enable the guest account so the organization that gets the computer can decide what level of control they want their users to have.</p>
<h2 id="is-there-anything-else-you-wish-to-share-with-us-about-your-organization-or-how-you-use-xubuntu">Is there anything else you wish to share with us about your organization or how you use Xubuntu?</h2>
<p>Thanks to the help of many past local volunteers, we have a system that lets us image Linux onto just about any PC made in the past 15 years. As mentioned before, we only have 3 images that we use. If you think about the tremendous variety of brands and models of computers made in that time frame, it is astounding how many combinations of equipment our (often non-technical) volunteers run into. Yet after a quick PXE-boot, Clonezilla automated script runs on those computers, it will reboot into a completely operational Linux environment is <strong>amazing</strong>! Xubuntu is so resillient to be able to run, without prompt for drivers, on so many different kinds of PC&rsquo;s! Now we are trying it on some Macs as well. Who knows how for we can go with it?</p>
<p>There is lots more information on our <a href="http://www.computerreach.org">website</a> (including the <a href="http://computerreach.org/news/">News page</a>) and social media sites – <a href="https://twitter.com/computerreach">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ComputeReach">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ComputeReach">YouTube</a> – with examples of where our computers are in use as well as our volunteers doing the work.</p>

   <p>Xubuntu core is a slimmed down version of Xubuntu that doesn’t come with all the additional features of a full and modern desktop. We essentially only ship Xfce and the basic look and feel of Xubuntu, so there will be no office suite, media players, et cetera.</p>
<p>The obvious benefit is that this ISO (about 600MB) will be faster to download – especially interesting for those with limited connectivity – and fit on a CD.</p>
<p>We have been working on this for a while, which is why you can already install it starting with Utopic. There are community ISOs for Vivid (see below), and starting with Wily, our plan is to produce official release ISOs!</p>
<h3 id="is-this-related-to-snappy-ubuntu-core-or-convergence">Is this related to Snappy, Ubuntu Core, or Convergence?</h3>
<p>Nope, sorry for the confusion in the name!</p>
<h3 id="ok-so-how-do-i-install-it-now">OK, so how do I install it now?</h3>
<p>The recommended way is to download the <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD">mini.iso</a>, install, and when prompted, install the <em>Xubuntu minimal installation</em> task. If you’d prefer to wait until after the installer finishes to install the Xubuntu core task, you can simply type <code>sudo apt-get install xubuntu-core^</code> (don’t forget the caret!) and away it’ll go.</p>
<p>Optionally for Vivid, if you don’t want to use the mini ISO or won’t have internet during install, you can install from the <a href="https://unit193.net/xubuntu/core/">community ISOs</a>, made available by a Xubuntu developer.</p>

<p>While it will continue to receive updates from the repository, we will no longer be providing any Xubuntu support for packages. Packages provided via Xubuntu-owned PPAs will also be discontinued.</p>
<p>All users are advised to upgrade their installation to the current LTS, Xubuntu 14.04 &ldquo;Trusty Tahr&rdquo;. This version will continue to receive support from Xubuntu until April 2017.

In this “Xubuntu at..” series of interviews, we seek to interview organizations who wish to share their stories. If your organization is using Xubuntu and you want to share what you’re doing with us please contact Elizabeth K. Joseph at <a href="mailto:lyz@ubuntu.com">lyz@ubuntu.com</a> to discuss details about your organization.</em></p>
<p>Late last year we heard from developer Greg Blumenthal when he told us that he&rsquo;d been deploying Xubuntu to customers who were &ldquo;extremely happy&rdquo; with their new systems. This month we took some time to ask him some questions about his work and the deployments.</p>
<p><strong>Can you tell us a bit about yourself and the organizations you work with?</strong></p>
<p>I am a freelance LAMP developer. Most of my clients are Mexican debt collection agencies, although I also work with food processing companies, telemarketers, and B2B VoIP companies.</p>
<p><strong>What influenced your decision to use Free/Open Source Software for your customers?</strong></p>
<p>Stability, ease of installation, ease of management, timely security updates. Interestingly, cost is NOT an issue here, as pirate copies of Windows are readily available.</p>
<p><strong>What made you select Xubuntu specifically?</strong></p>
<p>Low memory footprint, ease of installation on older systems, and ease of configuration to appear as familiar as possible to the end-users.</p>
<p><strong>Can you tell us a bit about your Xubuntu setup?</strong></p>
<p>I remove games, xchat, and other work distractions, and add openssh-server (allowing remote management), ntp, samba, and a SIP client (usually Zoiper or SFLphone). Everything is configures for Spanish with either Spanish or Latin American keyboards. I even install it in Spanish, even though English is my first language.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anything else you wish to share with us about your work or how you use Xubuntu?</strong></p>
<p>The biggest challenge is always sound. Whether it is ALSA or PulseAudio, I spend more time and effort managing sound issues for my clients than all other issues combined.</p>
<p>Huge thanks to Greg for taking the time to talk to us, and best of luck in his continued work with Xubuntu!</p>

   <p>Manual testing of the development version is an important part of the development cycle. The goal of manual testing is to find bugs that have been introduced during the cycle.</p>
<p>Finding these gives developers the opportunity to fix issues before the release. The sooner they are found, the bigger the possibility is that the bugs are fixed before regular users see them on their desktop. Without manual testers, our releases would be buggy. All that being said, <strong>we need your help doing manual testing</strong>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, manual testing can often be a tedious and thankless job for the contributors who are doing the testing and bug reporting for the community. This cycle we&rsquo;re hoping to change that up a bit.</p>
<p><strong>We will be giving out</strong> 7 <a href="http://www.unixstickers.com/stickers/linux_os_distribution_stickers/xubuntu-stickers-bundle">Xubuntu Sticker Bundles</a> from now through April to selected top testers on the following schedule:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Timespan</th>
<th>Admissible test reports</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>February</strong></td>
<td>Test reports from start of cycle to 28th February</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>March</strong></td>
<td>Test reports from 1st March to 31st March</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Final Beta</strong></td>
<td>Tests reported during the milestone</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>April</strong></td>
<td>Test reports from 1st April to 23rd April (end of the cycle)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Final Release</strong></td>
<td>Tests reported during milestone</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Cycle</strong></td>
<td>Tests reported during the whole Vivid Vervet cycle</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Depending on the success of this initiative we&rsquo;ll look into adding Xubuntu t-shirts and Ubuntu books to the program during the LTS cycle leading up to April 2016.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-participate">How can I participate?</h2>
<p>To help us out with testing <strong>and</strong> be considered as a sticker bundle recipient, do the following:</p>

<p>To celebrate the 14.10 codename &ldquo;Utopic Unicorn&rdquo; and to demonstrate the easy customisability of Xubuntu, highlight colors have been turned pink for this release. You can easily revert this change by using the theme configuration application (gtk-theme-config) under the Settings Manager; simply turn Custom Highlight Colors &ldquo;Off&rdquo; and click &ldquo;Apply&rdquo;. Of course, if you wish, you can change the highlight color to something you like better than the default blue!</p>
<p>Starting with Xubuntu 14.10, you should use pkexec instead of gksudo for running graphical applications with root access from the terminal for improved security. The Xubuntu team has prepared and shipped the necessary pkexec policy files for all default applications in the Xubuntu installation that we deemed necessary.</p>
<p>Please note that changes in the default configuration affect all users who haven&rsquo;t changed the default configuration. Read more about the default configuration changes in the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UtopicUnicorn/ReleaseNotes/Xubuntu#Changes_to_Xubuntu_Default_Settings">release notes</a>.</p>
<h4 id="highlights">Highlights</h4>
<ul>
<li>New Xfce Power Manager plugin is added to the panel <em>Note: Upgraders from Trusty will not see the new xfce4-power-manager panel plugin by default, but instead stick to indicator-power. This can easily be resolved by uninstalling indicator-power and adding the &ldquo;Power Manager Plugin&rdquo; to the panel.</em></li>
<li>Items in the newly themed alt-tab dialog can now be clicked with the mouse</li>

         Using inxi to detect hardware information

   <p>inxi is a full featured system information script that will detect information about hardware specifications, including but not limited to vendor details, CPU info, graphic and sound cards. Most importantly, it will output everything in a easy to read format and it can also be used on irc clients like irssi, weechat or xchat.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-inxi">How to use inxi?</h2>
<p>The general use of inxi is <code>inxi -&lt;color&gt; -&lt;option&gt;</code>. inxi output is colored and to change the color for better visibility use the <strong>c</strong> option followed by a number between 0-32.</p>
<h3 id="system-information">System information</h3>
<p><code>inxi -b</code> and <code>inxi -F</code>
The <strong>b</strong> option output basic system information, while the <strong>F</strong> option will output full system information.</p>
<h3 id="hard-drive-details">Hard drive details</h3>
<p><code>inxi -D</code>
Outputs information on your hard drives, like make, model and size</p>
<h3 id="hard-drive-partitions">Hard drive partitions</h3>
<p><code>inxi -p</code>
Outputs information about all mounted partitions, mount points and space usage</p>
<h3 id="networking">Networking</h3>
<p><code>inxi -n</code> and <code>inxi -ni</code>
Outputs information about the details of the network interfaces and configuration. When the <strong>i</strong> option is used with <strong>n</strong>, Inxi will output IP address details (for both WAN and LAN).</p>
<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>
<p><code>inxi -AG</code> and <code>inxi -h</code>
The <strong>A</strong> and <strong>G</strong> options output information about the audio and graphics hardware respectively. You usually want to use them together. The <strong>h</strong> option outputs you the full list of options you can use to get even more information about your hardware.</p>
<h2 id="using-inxi-in-irc-clients">Using inxi in IRC clients</h2>
<h3 id="xchat-irssi-and-most-other-clients">Xchat, irssi and most other clients</h3>
<p><code>/exec -o inxi -&lt;option&gt; | pastebinit</code>
The -o option shows the output to the channel. Without it, only the user will see the output.</p>
<h3 id="weechat">Weechat</h3>
<p><code>/shell -o inxi -&lt;option&gt; | pastebinit</code>
<em>Note: For weechat to run external scripts like inxi, shell.py has to be installed.</em></p>
<p>Using <code>inxi -c0</code> within a IRC client environment is highly advisable because colored output doesn&rsquo;t work in pastebins.</p>

<p>If you experienced problems with logging into your session after suspending your laptop by closing the lid (and only this exact scenario!), your days of worry should be over now. Many users have commented on the <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xubuntu-default-settings/+bug/1303736">respective bugreport</a>, many of whom experienced different issues with suspending. This made the issue very difficult to pinpoint in the beginning for us technical folk and confusing for users too.</p>
<p>Sean Davis, Technical Lead of Xubuntu, put together the pieces we collected after identifying the issue and the fix landed in the 14.04.1 and 14.10 Beta 1 releases. This means that <strong>the problem is fixed for</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New installs</strong> of Xubuntu 14.04.1 or Xubuntu 14.10 Beta 1</li>
<li><strong>New users</strong> created with xubuntu-default-settings 14.04.5</li>
</ul>
<p>All those of you who have been running Trusty since its release have to toggle a setting in order to <strong>fix the issue for existing user-accounts:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Open <code>Light Locker Settings</code> from the <code>Settings Manager</code></li>
<li>Turn &ldquo;Enable Light Locker&rdquo; <strong>Off</strong>. Click &ldquo;Apply&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Turn &ldquo;Enable Light Locker&rdquo; <strong>On</strong>. Click &ldquo;Apply&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>
<p>These steps have to followed manually because we never overwrite existing user settings. Obviously, if you previously had disabled Light Locker, the last step is sufficient.</p>

         5 Things to Do After Upgrading from 12.04 to 14.04
      </a>
   </h1>

         <li>14.04</li>
      
      
   </ul>

   <p>The first point release of 14.04 just came out a few days ago and many LTS users waited for this to upgrade from 12.04 – in fact <code>do-release-upgrade</code> only offers the LTS to LTS upgrade after the first point release for stability reasons. So we thought this would be the perfect time to do a quick writeup of a few things to do after upgrading your system. User configuration isn&rsquo;t updated and installed applications aren&rsquo;t removed when upgrading and that&rsquo;s a good thing: Upgraders will not have to restore their customizations and their system will mostly look as before. However, for those of you who want to get closer to the default setup of Xubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr, here go five easy steps you can quickly follow to that end.</p>

<p><strong>Light Locker</strong> has replaced XScreenSaver. Light Locker uses LightDM to lock the screen, merging the functionality of the login screen and the lock screen. Having both applications installed at the same time may produce bugs or regressions, so it is recommended to remove XScreenSaver. To remove it just run the following command in a terminal window: <code>sudo apt-get remove xscreensaver</code></p>
<p>If you would rather see a screensaver instead of an improved screen locker, you can alternatively remove Light Locker and keep XScreenSaver.</p>

<p><strong>MenuLibre</strong>, an advanced menu editor that provides modern features in a clean, easy-to-use interface, with full Xfce support, replaces Alacarte for menu editing. To remove Alacarte open a terminal window and run the following command: <code>sudo apt-get remove alacarte</code></p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="http://localhost:1313/news/releases/14.04/5-things-to-do-after-upgrading-from-12-04-to-14-04/ristretto.png"/> </figure>

<p>Due to a duplication of functionalities, the Xubuntu Team decided to favor <strong>Ristretto</strong> for photo viewing, and drop gThumb. To remove gThumb from your system run in a terminal window: <code>sudo apt-get remove gthumb</code></p>

<figure>

<p>As <strong>Whiskermenu</strong> is now the default menu in Xubuntu, swap out the old application menu with it. Just right click the top panel and navigate to <strong>Panel &gt; Add New Items</strong>, then select &ldquo;Whisker Menu&rdquo; and click &ldquo;Add&rdquo;. After that, and to remove the old application menu, just right click on its icon and choose the &ldquo;Remove&rdquo; option.</p>

<p>All <strong>PPAs are automatically disabled</strong> when you upgrade, so you&rsquo;ll have to re-enable release-independent PPAs manually, taking in consideration that you&rsquo;ll have to check if the old PPAs work with the new Xubuntu version.</p>

   <p>Improving screenlocking (or: sessionlocking) has been on our agenda for a few cycles now. We&rsquo;ve used the old and proven XScreensaver for a few releases, but people have always complained about its antiquated looks (which are also not customizable). Switching to gnome-screensaver wasn&rsquo;t an option because of the additional package dependencies. Furthermore, after gnome-screensaver 3.6, locking became more tightly integrated into Gnome-Shell, which is why Ubuntu/Unity kept version 3.6 and has maintained it for a few releases now.</p>
<p>Starting with 14.04, Ubuntu/Unity have switched to a new solution for locking, and so have we.</p>

</p>
<p>The solution Xubuntu uses in 14.04 is called <strong>light-locker</strong>. The light-locker project is a fork of gnome-screensaver 3.6, but cut down to a bare minimum (so no gnome-dependencies), using LightDM&rsquo;s greeter as the lock (and unlock) screen.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-the-screenlocking-work">How does the screenlocking work?</h2>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t too many changes for users. The light-locker process operates in the background and people can still lock their session in the ways they used to (e.g. through Whiskermenu&rsquo;s lock launcher or through a keyboard shortcut invoking &ldquo;xflock4&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Settings are configurable via a settings dialog developed for Xubuntu 14.04, called Light Locker Settings. The tool can be found in the the Settings Manager. It allows you to configure whether your session should be locked automatically after a timeout and the screen-blank and off times. The dialog is still, for the moment, basic, but it should allow you enough control. Refinements are planned for future cycles/releases.</p>
<p>One thing that changes for users is the fact that locking with LightDM means that a new virtual terminal is opened. In a default single-user session, the user&rsquo;s X session rests at VT7 (reachable with the keyboard-shortcut <code>Ctrl</code>+<code>Alt</code>+<code>F7</code>). When you lock your session, LightDM sends a lock signal, light-locker locks the session on VT7 and you get forwarded to VT8, where you&rsquo;re presented with the login greeter, which serves as the unlock dialog.</p>
<p>The aforementioned change introduces one inconvenience you might (or might not) notice: when light-locker switches the VT, there is some screenflickering and it could take a second or two on older machines.</p>
<h2 id="what-happened-to-my-music-playback">What happened to my music playback?</h2>
<p>As your seat becomes inactive, your audio stream is stopped/paused until you log into your session again. This is one of the known issues of light-locker or locking with LightDM in general.</p>
<p>Currently, when locking, it is assumed you are either:</p>
<ol>
<li>in a public space of sorts (the desktop at home hardly needs locking) and have walked away from the machine</li>
<li>using a system with more than one user</li>
</ol>
<p>Stopping/pausing playback in both of these scenarios make sense.</p>
<p>However, this might be an annoying change for users used to having their music playback continue even when their session locks. If you don&rsquo;t like this behavior, there are basically two solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set light-locker to lock the session &ldquo;When the screensaver is deactivated&rdquo;</li>
<li>Switch back to using xscreensaver</li>
<li>Add your user to the &ldquo;audio&rdquo; group on your computer and music playback will continue also with light-locker</li>
</ol>
<p>The first option is a good workaround, because it means that your audio-playback will continue when the screen has been blanked. However, when you wake up your computer, e.g. by touching the mouse, it will pause the music until you log into your session again. The third solution is mentioned last, because it isn&rsquo;t <em>advised</em> to add your user to the &ldquo;audio&rdquo; group (read <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Audio/TheAudioGroup?highlight=%28audio%29">The Audio Group</a> wiki page for a comprehensive explanation). However, as long as you&rsquo;re on a single-user system, this might still be an option for you.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-have-a-screensaver-other-than-the-blank-screen-with-light-locker">Can I have a screensaver other than the blank screen with light-locker?</h2>
<p>In a word – no.</p>
<p>If you need a screensaver for whatever reason, perhaps using a TV for a monitor and don&rsquo;t want a blank screen, then you will need to remove light-locker and install some alternative, like xscreensaver.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>From Xubuntu 14.04 on, we can finally provide a visually consistent way of logging in to and locking your session with light-locker. As mentioned above, there is a conceptual change in how we look at locking in Xubuntu (which to some might seem like a small regression), however, there are still good alternatives for those who don&rsquo;t agree with our vision.</p>
<h2 id="known-issues">Known Issues</h2>
<p>Currently, you might run into this known issue (that we discovered only when the release was already imminent), which we&rsquo;re already working on fixing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Xfce4 Power Manager does not restore screen power (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xfce4-power-manager/+bug/1259339">1259339</a>) – see the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TrustyTahr/ReleaseNotes/Xubuntu">release notes for details and workarounds</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Also, upgraders from previous Xubuntu versions might run into trouble because XScreensaver and light-locker are both installed. Just get rid of one of the two to resolve that.</p>

         Xubuntu 14.04 QA Recap

   </h1>

   <ul class="meta">
      
      
      <li><time datetime="2014-04-28T16:13:27&#43;00:00">April 28, 2014</time></li>
      
         <li>14.04</li>
      
      
   </ul>

   <p>Now that Trusty is out the door, we thought that the time was right to bring you a recap of what you&rsquo;ve managed to do for Xubuntu during the last cycle and what we&rsquo;ve been up to behind the curtain. Those of you who frequent the #xubuntu-devel channel are likely aware of how much the work people testing do is appreciated. The remainder of you perhaps don&rsquo;t, or just assume so.</p>
<p>So without further dithering I&rsquo;ll get right on with it.</p>
<h2 id="package-testing">Package Testing</h2>
<p>Following on from the huge effort made during the Saucy cycle to create new testcases, we were able to use this work during the whole of this LTS cycle. For the first time Xubuntu were able to use specific tests for the applications and packages as well as images. There are in excess of 200 reports recorded in the package tracker for this last cycle. It does make life a lot easier to know we have this availability, the reported bugs make it onto a blueprint from where we can monitor progress during the cycle. Whether we use the same entire set of tests for the next cycle is not set yet, possibly we&rsquo;ll work differently in non-LTS cycles.</p>
<p>For the various sections we have on our tracker</p>
<ul>
<li>Xfce Applications (8 tests) - 58 reports</li>
<li>Xfce Core (9 tests) - 53 reports</li>
<li>Xfce Settings Manager (13 tests) - 59 reports</li>
<li>Xubuntu Applications (6 tests) - 23 reports</li>
<li>Xubuntu Networking (4 tests) - 10 reports</li>
<li>Trusty Additional (6 tests) - 29 reports</li>
</ul>
<p>Something to take away from all this reporting - you&rsquo;ve found and reported 50 bugs during the cycle, that is more than for Ubuntu Desktop, Kylin Desktop, Lubuntu Desktop, Ubuntu Gnome and Common Desktop combined, <strong>that is great work</strong>.</p>
<p>Thanks should go to those of you involved in the original effort to write them and to those who have taken the time to report at the tracker and fed back the bugs you found.</p>
<h2 id="image-testing">Image Testing</h2>
<h3 id="daily-and-milestone-testing">Daily and Milestone Testing</h3>
<p>Nothing new going on in this area during the Trusty cycle. We tend to get more testing done in a short time during milestones, over the whole cycle we&rsquo;ve had almost 800 reported tests for daily image testing.</p>
<p>That number can be broken down to</p>
<p><strong>Daily testing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>64-bit 293</li>
<li>32-bit 316</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Milestone testing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>64-bit 73</li>
<li>32-bit 86</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="upgrade-testing">Upgrade Testing</h3>
<p>This was always going to be important this cycle. Not only is there an upgrade path from 13.10 to 14.04 for us to test, but as this cycle ends with the release of the new LTS, we&rsquo;ve had 12.04 to 14.04 to contend with in addition.</p>
<p>Increasing the importance of this upgrade path has been the new landing applications for the 14.04 release, GTK3 indicators, the change to light-locker from xscreensaver, and the visual changes - loss of the bottom panel being the most obvious.</p>
<p><strong>12.04 to 14.04 upgrade</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Beta 1 and previous- 9 tests</li>
<li>Beta 2 None</li>
<li>post Beta 2 - 17 tests</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>13.10 to 14.04</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Beta 1 and previous - 4 tests</li>
<li>Beta 2 None</li>
<li>post-Beta 2 - 20 tests</li>
</ul>
<p>As can be seen the numbers weren&rsquo;t so good here.</p>
<h2 id="launchpad-groups">Launchpad groups</h2>
<h3 id="xubuntu-testers">xubuntu-testers</h3>
<p>This cycle we actually made use of this user group during testing calls. I suspect that came as a surprise to those in that group but not subscribed to the -devel mailing list, get used to it though - it won&rsquo;t be changing. For those of you who get the same mail twice, I apologise - a bit.</p>
<p>It <em>could</em> be that it made a difference - but there&rsquo;s no way of actually telling if it did or not. What can be said is that this cycle we&rsquo;ve seen new people appearing on the two trackers we use. This is obviously good, but the 2 trackers we use have in the region of 30 names on them, which the whole team would love to see increase. When you know that there are at least ~143,000 installed xubuntu-default-settings out there, around 40 reporting testers isn&rsquo;t a great deal.</p>
<p>Specific thanks go to these users who actually did the reporting for us: akxwi-dave, bb70, bryanquigley, cc-inc, decockbernard, dkessel, dp-w, elfy, eric-koegel, gayle-adamyan, gridcube, hallo32, hugoangelo, irihapeti, j-bardales, jhe, jibel, jjfrv8, knome, lderan, lyz, migouste, noskcaj, paulocesarsc, paulw2u, pianoforte, samuelgabbay1, schproodle, scottbomb, sergio-br2, skellat, slickymaster, smiddy84, texadactyl, toz, truckinpapa, unit193, voxtred, wkrekik, zakzor</p>
<p>It really does make a difference to us to see the users, reports and associated bugs.</p>
<h3 id="xubuntu-qa">xubuntu-qa</h3>
<p>This new group was created with the intention that a route into the xubuntu-team now existed for this important part of the development cycle. Previously there was no obvious route into xubuntu-team for those working predominately in testing and QA. If you are interested in being part of the QA team - then we&rsquo;ll be wanting to see you in the IRC channel and on the mailing list.</p>
<h2 id="blogging-on-xubuntu">Blogging on Xubuntu</h2>
<p>This cycle, in addition to the normal release notes at milestone time, we have been using the website to talk about aspects of the QA cycle.</p>
<p>This will continue into the next cycle - at which point we&rsquo;ll take a breath and think again. If anyone has any thoughts or ideas of articles that we could look to write, then please contact a member of the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~xubuntu-qa">QA Launchpad team</a>.</p>
<h2 id="social-media">Social Media</h2>
<p>The Xubuntu website team have been ensuring that any calls from QA for milestone testing have been mentioned on at least one or more of Twitter, Facebook or Google+.</p>
<p>During the next cycle we&rsquo;ll look towards including the regular calls for Package testing on our Social Media outlets.</p>
<h2 id="new-landings">New landings</h2>
<p>Testing for the new landing applications was never going to be an easy task - and it wasn&rsquo;t. Time was everyone&rsquo;s enemy here - time to do the work, then time to get testing done in a suitable manner for all concerned, the people dealing with the docs had to get the new docs ready as well. But, we did it - in time, and robust enough that we were happy to release with them.</p>
<h2 id="looking-forward-to-the-next-cycle">Looking forward to the next cycle</h2>
<p>So, shortly we&rsquo;ll start again with the next cycle, we hope that not only will those of you who&rsquo;ve walked the Trusty road with us carry on doing so, but that we get more people join us as we march towards October 2014.</p>
<p>We are still working towards automated testing for some of our applications, this is being effectively dealt with by just a couple of people in the team, <em>so if you are proficient with Python and are looking for something to do</em>, or just want to help Xubuntu, come and talk to us about that.</p>
<p>If you have any constructive thoughts or ideas on how we can improve the testing we do for Xubuntu, please feel free to mail us on the xubuntu-devel mailing list or pop into the IRC channel and talk to us.</p>

<h2 id="other-efforts-and-thanks">Other efforts and thanks</h2>
<p>As always, contributors to Xubuntu have worked on various projects not directly visible in the release. While any of these would be worth mentioning, the following are a few we felt may be of interest to the community:</p>
<ul>
<li>QA efforts, including ISO and package testing as well as bug reporting and triaging</li>
<li>Marketing projects, including work on a flyer to promote Xubuntu for people still running Windows XP</li>
<li>Website updates, including a theme refresh</li>
</ul>
<p>While many of the improvements in Xubuntu since the last LTS are, indeed, not directly visible. Some of the major improvements have been in design and theming, and as such we hope that you don&rsquo;t see them – good design should be invisible.</p>
<p>Thanks to everybody contributing to Xubuntu! As always, new contributors are always welcome to join us.

   <p>The <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StartUbuntu">StartUbuntu</a> project seeks to spread Ubuntu to individuals and organizations who are migrating away from Windows XP when support runs out later this year. As one of their initiatives, Pierre van Male created a flyer featuring Ubuntu and Linux Mate (<a href="http://spreadubuntu.org/en/material/poster/start-ubuntu-addis-announcement">available here</a>, A4 size only). We decided that this would be a great opportunity to create our own variation - with Xubuntu!</p>
<p>This month Elizabeth Krumbach Joseph and Pasi Lallinaho got to work on text and graphical updates to make this a reality and we&rsquo;re pleased to announce that the flyers have been created and uploaded to <a href="http://spreadubuntu.org/">SpreadUbuntu.org</a>! Since uploading, we&rsquo;ve also been inspired by community members who have begun translating it.</p>
<p><strong>Find the links to the flyer as well as all translated versions on the <a href="http://xubuntu.org/products/" title="Products">Products</a> page.</strong></p>
<p>If your language isn&rsquo;t represented yet, we encourage you to create translations in your own language and submit them to spreadubuntu.org. Once uploaded email Elizabeth at <a href="mailto:lyz@ubuntu.com">lyz@ubuntu.com</a> with the spreadubuntu link to get it included on the Products page.</p>

   <p>While testing the developer versions in any way possible is a great idea, there isn&rsquo;t much benefit in messages telling us Xubuntu works on machine X, or there were no problems with upgrading machine Y.</p>
<p>Why? It&rsquo;s not measurable.</p>
<p>The following sections will explain the kind of figures we would like to measure, why those figures are important and will hopefully give you some motivation to start running and and <em>reporting</em> tests.</p>
<h2 id="measuring-success-or-failure">Measuring success or failure</h2>
<p>The tests reported on the <a href="http://packages.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker">package</a> and <a href="http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker">ISO</a> trackers help us measure several figures, including:</p>
<p><strong>Bugs that are being reported.</strong> The number and quality of bugs help us measure how smooth the user experience is. In addition, since the bugs are found when running specific testcases, reproducing them is usually trivial, which in turn allows us to get working on them and get them fixed faster.</p>
<p>Of course, doing <em>exploratory testing</em> helps us find bugs that our usual routines do not catch. This is why it&rsquo;s <em>also</em> important to do tests that go beyond the testcases. If you find such bugs while running a testcase, please report them as well.</p>
<p><strong>The amount of testing that has been done.</strong> While quantity doesn&rsquo;t replace or imply quality, it&rsquo;s important to know how thoroughly the tests have been run. This is all the more true when people are able to run tests with varying hardware and not just <em>virtualized environments</em>.</p>
<p><strong>The number of people testing.</strong> Usually, more eyes find more bugs. Along with the number of tests run, this helps us get a sense of how thorough the testing was.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the last two figures also help us decide whether we need to run more calls for testers as we prepare for the next milestone or cadence testing.</p>
<h2 id="bring-out-your-results">Bring out your results</h2>
<p>Simply put, reported results are the only reliable way we have to gauge these figures. In the ideal situation, the number of bugs reported is going down while the number of testers and tests run is going up.</p>
<p>However, if the reported results we are currently looking at are the reality, then on average Xubuntu gets released after being tested by somewhere in the region of 20 people. After the release, the version in question is used by thousands. We&rsquo;re sure that you&rsquo;d not like to think that!</p>
<p>As you might gather, reporting tests is almost as important as your testing in the first place. Starting reporting will be an extra step or two for you, but don&rsquo;t be afraid – we will help you to get started and help you throughout.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>If you are one of those unsung heroes who is regularly out there testing for us – let us know, we&rsquo;ll be looking, as always, for new names on the trackers. Reports are made at each meeting on how testing has gone in the preceding week.</p>
<p>To get started, subscribe to the <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/xubuntu-devel">Xubuntu development mailing list</a> – you&rsquo;ll see all the calls from QA that way.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about how to get involved, then members of the Xubuntu QA team can usually be found in <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=xubuntu-devel">#xubuntu-devel</a> on Freenode and will be happy to help, as will most that you&rsquo;ll see in there.</p>
<p>Again, please remember that Xubuntu is a completely community driven project. If you are reading this and are running Xubuntu, consider giving back. Thank you!</p>

   </ul>

   <p>First of all, we&rsquo;d like to thank everyone who contributed to our contest! Thanks for giving us a choice and for making it a really difficult process to distill all submissions down to a set of 6 amazing looking wallpapers.</p>
<p>As announced at the outset, three members of the Xubuntu development team, namely Pasi Lallinaho (Project Lead), Elizabeth Krumbach (Marketing Lead) and Simon Steinbeiss (Artwork Lead) reviewed the lot of 81 submissions to the contest. In a discussion lasting over two hours, we looked at and discussed all wallpapers in question. It has to be mentioned that one of our criteria was to end up with a diverse set of wallpapers, as in: Xubuntu isn&rsquo;t only &ldquo;all blue&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Today, we would like to present the winners and outline quickly what we like about them or why they were chosen. Without further ado, here&rsquo;s the winning wallpapers, in alphabetical order:</p>

<p><strong>Balance by Gavin Ash</strong>
This is one of the more colorful submissions that made it to the group of winners. We&rsquo;re sure there are many users out there who will appreciate giving their desktop a very relaxed – and balanced – mood, while at the same time having vivid colors. It is also the definite wallpaper for breaks, when you want to dream about the forthcoming summer.</p>

<p><strong>Bubbles by Francisco Villarroel</strong>
The combination of simplicity and retro-colors caught our eye in this submission. The different ways the light enters the composition and adds various effects and colors makes it pleasant to look at and keeps it interesting, even after having it on your desktop for weeks.</p>

        <img src="http://localhost:1313/news/releases/14.04/community-wallpaper-contest-winners/kaydendmello_cloudbreaker_250.jpg"/> </figure>

<p><strong>Cloudbreaker by Kayden D&rsquo;Mello</strong>
This beautiful mountain-top composition exhibits a very particular color-range, favoring cyan. We fell in love with the texture of the rock and the great composition of the clouds. Finally, we think that this wallpaper makes you feel like you&rsquo;re at the top of the world – hopefully this can inspire you to reach your goals and more.</p>

        <img src="http://localhost:1313/news/releases/14.04/community-wallpaper-contest-winners/simonsteinbeiss_justrocks_250.jpg"/> </figure>

<p><strong>Just Rocks by Simon Steinbeiss</strong>
While Simon, the author and the Artwork Lead, disqualified himself on voting for this photo, we definitely wanted to include it in the package. The photo has a lot of small details to look at, but will efficiently keep out of the way and in the background when you need to focus on other tasks at hand.</p>

        <img src="http://localhost:1313/news/releases/14.04/community-wallpaper-contest-winners/gavinash_solitude_250.jpg"/> </figure>

<p><strong>Solitude by Gavin Ash</strong>
This stunning view into a forest contrasts the technology you&rsquo;re using to get your stuff done with the beautiful experience of nature. While we hope that you will enjoy your time using Xubuntu, maybe this will also inspire you to step out and take a breath of fresh air – something we think this photograph nicely conveys.</p>

<p><strong>Traslasierra by Adrian Felipe Pera</strong>
This wallpaper features a very balanced sky against a very defined mountain chain glowing in the red light of dawn or dusk (which ever mental image you like better!). What we liked very much about this wallpaper is the vision of looking into the distance, into the great wide open. In addition to all the things mentioned before, this mountainous range works very nicely in a multi-monitor setup.</p>
<hr>
<p>These wallpapers will be shipped with Xubuntu 14.04. They will also available in the package xubuntu-community-wallpapers in the Ubuntu software repository for those who use other desktops.</p>
<p>The full resolution wallpapers are available for testing already in the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Roadmap/Specifications/Trusty/CommunityWallpapers/Winners">Winners for 14.04 wallpaper contest</a> page in the Xubuntu wiki.</p>
<p>Again, congratulations to the winners and thanks for your numerous submissions!</p>

   <p>The Xubuntu team is happy to announce the immediate release of Xubuntu 14.04 Alpha 2!</p>
<p>As often expected with very early cycle releases, this release has some issues which we will be working to resolve before the final release.</p>
<p>Notably, it is impossible to successfully use the Alpha 2 to set up an auto-resized system automatically. You will not be able to set the partition sizes.</p>

   <p>The Xubuntu team is happy to announce the immediate release of Xubuntu 14.04 Alpha 1!</p>
<p>As often expected with very early cycle releases, this release has some major issues which we will be working to resolve before the final release. The main issues center around the various User Session bugs seen.</p>
<p>To boot successfully to a Xubuntu Desktop on the Live DVD you need to set the session to Xubuntu at the Gear Icon, Language at the Flag Icon and use username xubuntu. You may notice that the Settings Manager is joined with it&rsquo;s applications in the menu we used to see. It is also impossible to successfully use the Alpha1 to set up an auto-resized system automatically. You will not be able to set the partition sizes.</p>
<p>Thanks to the 8 people who tested and reported their results on the Alpha1 image for us:</p>

   <p>In less than 6 months time we will release Xubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr, a long-term release which will be supported for 3 years. Even if you have never dabbled in testing – now is the time to have a go!</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-help">How can I help?</h2>
<p>Testing Xubuntu is an important step on the way to the release of a stable operating system. With proper and reported testing we are able to find out the bugs and issues and iron them out before the final release.</p>
<p>You can find a basic overview of how testing is set up at the Ubuntu QA <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/Roles/Tester">wiki</a>, but do bear in mind that our requirements are more specific and some of that page is aimed at Ubuntu testing.</p>
<p>We have two different areas of testing, which vary in depth and length. This makes it easy to find a test suitable for your schedule and skills, but remember: <strong>only reported tests count!</strong> You can help us with testing either</p>
<ul>
<li>daily images, in the <a href="http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/">ISO QA tracker</a>; or</li>
<li>packages included in Xubuntu, in the <a href="http://packages.qa.ubuntu.com/">packages QA tracker</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Got a question before you start? Come along to the <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=xubuntu-devel">#xubuntu-devel IRC channel</a> and ask there, or, if you prefer to, mail us at the <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/xubuntu-devel">Xubuntu developer mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>Updates to our testing requirements are made regularly to the development mailing list. However, please do not hesitate to be in contact if you are in doubt; we will gladly help.</p>

         Xubuntu 14.04 Default Wallpapers
      </a>
   </h1>

         <li>14.04</li>
      
      
   </ul>

   <p>We&rsquo;re happy to announce that for 14.04 we plan to integrate a set of good-looking wallpapers by default. This is a feature many have been lacking for a while, we repeatedly heard/read about it in reviews. And we think the upcoming 14.04 LTS release is the perfect time to finally tackle this issue.</p>
<p>We want the community (yes, you who is reading this!) to participate in this process – so we&rsquo;re looking for your wallpaper submissions!</p>
<h3 id="what-kind-of-wallpapers">What kind of wallpapers?</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;ve put together a page with guidelines – please follow them as closely as possible. <strong>Note:</strong> The wallpapers have to have the appropriate license, which is <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC-BY-SA</a>. Submissions that violate those guidelines gravely (e.g. posting sexually explicit images) will be removed from the submissions page without further notice.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve participated in Ubuntu&rsquo;s wallpaper contest, <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Roadmap/Specifications/Trusty/CommunityWallpapers">these guidelines</a> will look familiar to you.</p>
<h3 id="decision-making">Decision making</h3>
<p>Our decision making will be transparent, i.e. public and out in the open (we&rsquo;ll hold an IRC meeting in #xubuntu-devel when the decision is due). However, it will be a decision taken by the Xubuntu artwork team, so it&rsquo;s not a wallpaper contest in the sense that everyone with internet access will get to vote.</p>
<p>Our goal is to have a multifaceted set of wallpapers – with respect to motifs and colors (e.g. not &ldquo;all blue&rdquo;, &ldquo;only pictures of sky+clouds&rdquo;). It is hard to say before seeing the final list of submissions how this might change our decision, but it will certainly affect it. (Just to let you know in advance.)</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t decided on the amount of wallpapers to include; ultimately, it also depends on the amount of submissions.</p>
<h3 id="where-and-how-to-submit">Where and how to submit</h3>
<p>You can submit your wallpapers by uploading them <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Roadmap/Specifications/Trusty/CommunityWallpapers/Submissions">to the Xubuntu Wiki</a>. You&rsquo;ll need an Ubuntu Single Sign-On account to be able to attach wallpapers.</p>
<p>Important: Please always include the authors&rsquo; credit and a link to the original (we need to double-check and possibly get in touch with the authors)!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Roadmap/Specifications/Trusty/CommunityWallpapers/Submissions">submissions</a>!</p>

   <p><em>The Xubuntu team hears stories about how it is used in organizations all over the world. In this &ldquo;Xubuntu at..&rdquo; series of interviews, we seek to interview organizations who wish to share their stories. If your organization is using Xubuntu and you want to share what you&rsquo;re doing with us please contact Elizabeth Krumbach Joseph at <a href="mailto:lyz@ubuntu.com">lyz@ubuntu.com</a> to discuss details about your organization.</em></p>
<p>Back in September we heard from Chris Wiley of <em>Techs for a Cause</em> and were put in touch with Justin Henneberg to answer some questions about their organization and how they use Xubuntu. Justin replied with an exceptionally thoughtful and inspiring reply which we&rsquo;re happy to share here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are a small group of like minded individuals that have a strong belief in decreasing the digital divide. In other words, we are dedicated to helping others gain access to an essential part of modern life - a computer. We also want to do the right thing for the environment by keeping otherwise good computer components out of landfills. Working with computers is a hobby for us. None of us are employed in the IT field, and each of us have our own unique backgrounds. For example, one of us drives a truck for a living, another works in a local school district, and another does adult foster care with developmentally disabled adults.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our choice to use Linux was a conscious (and logical) decision since it is an open-source operating system, and we have no official budget or source of income. We chose Xubuntu in particular because of the large repositories offered through Ubuntu and Synaptic. It offers the low resource requirements that run best with the systems we rehab, and is balanced with more functionality and ease of use than some other distros such as Lubuntu.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Personally, I believe in open-source because it is a gateway for innovation, accessibility, and equality. Open-source software is the future, as can already be seen by the explosion of the Android fork of Linux. Android had become what it is, because it is open-source. There are many great programs that are open-source, and they often are better than the paid versions because it is passion, rather than profits that drive them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A couple of final great things about Linux: You get the opportunity to learn! If you aren&rsquo;t learning, you aren&rsquo;t living. Lower virus exposure (not as many viruses are written for Linux due to market share) coupled with increased security measures. I truly could go on and on about the benefits of Linux and open-source, but so many of the things I would say would be redundant and obvious, needless to say I LOVE Linux!&rdquo;</p>

   </ul>

   <h2 id="time-to-reveal-your-desktop">Time to reveal your desktop!</h2>
<p>The Xubuntu team is proud to announce a recently launched new project to celebrate our community: the <a href="http://xubuntu-showcase.deviantart.com/">Xubuntu Showcase group</a> group on <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/">deviantART</a>!</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-goal-of-this-project">What is the goal of this project?</h3>
<p>The ultimate goal of this project is to have &ldquo;Desktop of the Week&rdquo; gallery on our website. Each week we will choose a single submission among the pool and showcase it in the front page of the official Xubuntu website as well as promote it on all of our social network outlets and let others do the same!</p>
<p>With the showcase we hope to bring light and interest over our beautiful and interesting desktop and convince the non-believers! And remember, all the screenshots are from real, stable systems configured to suit different workflows and usecases, which proves the Xubuntu desktop a truly configurable versatile desktop.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-take-a-screenshot">How do I take a screenshot?</h3>
<p>To take a screenshot you can simply press the corresponding key on your keyboard. On regular keyboards, look for the &ldquo;Print Screen&rdquo; or &ldquo;Prt Sc&rdquo; key, or in modern laptops and special keyboards this key might be under some Function key. Alternatively, you can launch the Xfce Screenshot tool from the Applications menu, under Accessories » Screenshot.</p>
<p>Please note that all screenshots need to follow the submission guidelines, which are listed on the front page of the <a href="http://xubuntu-showcase.deviantart.com/">Xubuntu Showcase group</a>. Once you&rsquo;ve made sure your screenshot follows the guidelines and is to your liking you can proceed to submit it!</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-submit-my-screenshot">How do I submit my screenshot?</h3>
<p>For now, we only accept submissions sent directly to our deviantART group. To get your screenshot in the moderation queue, simply propose your screenshot for the <a href="http://xubuntu-showcase.deviantart.com/">Xubuntu Showcase group</a> in the <a href="http://xubuntu-showcase.deviantart.com/gallery/44567713">&ldquo;Proposed&rdquo; folder</a>.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve submitted your screenshot, our moderators will process it as soon as possible. If the submission adheres to the guidelines, it will be eventually approved and added to the pool of images where we draw the showcased screenshots. If it does not adhere to guidelines, we will reply with rationale.</p>
<p>Default basic minimal look xubuntu starts on:</p>

   <p><em>The Xubuntu team hears stories about how it is used in organizations all over the world. In this &ldquo;Xubuntu at..&rdquo; series of interviews, we seek to interview organizations who wish to share their stories. If your organization is using Xubuntu and you want to share what you&rsquo;re doing with us please contact Elizabeth Krumbach Joseph at <a href="mailto:lyz@ubuntu.com">lyz@ubuntu.com</a> to discuss details about your organization.</em></p>
<p>Jeff Hanson of <em>Project: Community Computers</em> recently contacted the Xubuntu developers to introduce the work his organization is doing and ask about how best to give feedback. We took this opportunity to launch our <em>&ldquo;Xubuntu at&hellip;&rdquo;</em> series of interviews by asking him more about the organization!</p>
<p><strong>Please tell us a bit about yourself and Project: Community Computers.</strong></p>
<p>Mission Statement: “Project: Community Computers reduces e-waste and bridges the digital divide by reusing and recycling computers and bringing technology access to those in need.”</p>
<p>We started as a student group at the Milwaukee School of Engineering in 2009. Our mission is to kill two birds with one stone. Millions of tons of working computer hardware are thrown away every year, and billions of people around the world are with extremely limited access to technology. If you think about all that having a computer and Internet access opens up for you in the 21st Century, you’d have to wonder how people without it ever compete. No doing your homework when you go home from school. No using it to search and apply for jobs. No using it the unlimited resources to expand your knowledge and skill sets. We aim to give people a critical tool to break the cycle of poverty.</p>
<p>This isn’t even a developing world problem, there are almost 30 million people in the United States alone that don’t have a computer at home. We aim to redirect computers from the landfill to people that use them around the world. We’ve set up public computer labs at schools, community centers, and churches in Kenya, Cameroon, Mexico, and China, just to name a few places, in addition to our growing body of work in inner city Milwaukee.</p>

<p>After being a student group for so many years, we’re currently working on turning Project:CC into an independent 501c(3) to expand and sustain our mission.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.projectcc.org/?page_id=409">Read more about Project: Community Computers</a></p>
<p><strong>What influenced your decision to use Open Source software in your organization?</strong></p>
<p>There are both practical and ideological reasons for using open source software. Putting open source software on donated hardware allows us to give technology access to the people that need it for free. All we have to add are tech skills and time. Furthermore, what the open source movement is trying to do with software is the exact same idea as what we are trying to do with technology access: Democratization, equal access, and equal opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>What made you select Xubuntu for your deployments?</strong></p>
<p>It’s no secret that Ubuntu is one of the most user-friendly Linux distributions, if not operating systems, around, so using Ubuntu was a no-brainer for us, especially since many of our users have had very limited access to and experience with computers. This is not even to speak of stability and security inherent with Linux.</p>
<p>Since we use a lot of donated, older hardware, Xubuntu&rsquo;s lightweight Xfce environment makes it so even 10 year old hardware runs smoothly. Occasionally, we’ll get some hardware so old that even Xubuntu won’t run and we have to recycle it, but Xubuntu allows us to get more donated hardware into the hands of people who need it.</p>

<p><strong>Can you tell us a bit about your Xubuntu setup?</strong></p>
<p>We start with the current Xubuntu LTS, and then we add all four Edubuntu packs from the software center. So you have all the educational content of Edubuntu with the lightweight stable interface of Xubuntu.</p>
<p>Recently we decided to add LibreOffice and remove Abiword and Gnumeric. I really enjoyed the simplicity of these two programs, however they were lacking some compatibility and the switch really came when we needed a presentation program and decided we should just move all productivity software to Libre to keep things as easy for our users as possible.</p>
<p>A few other programs are added as well such as Celestia, Xaos, Skype, Dropbox, and we continue to keep an eye out for good programs.</p>
<p>The rest is just little settings, like having the system autologin (so users in the lab don’t ever need a password unless changing settings.), frequency of getting updates, sending feedback, power settings, etc.</p>
<p>We do the whole install on something small like an 8gig flash drive and create the image off of this. Then we can throw the image on any usb drive or hard drive 8 gigs or more.</p>
<p>Imaging becomes overly simple by using Ubuntu because there really are no proprietary drivers. We have one image. The image can be put on any type of hard drive and into any computer and it will boot the same. (Just another example of how Ubuntu allows our project to work so effectively )</p>
<p>For us to image a drive it takes between 7 and 10 minutes depending on the connection. This means if we have a laptop donated for example, and say windows wasn&rsquo;t booting properly, or it had a virus, it’s a matter of removing the hard drive, waiting 10 minutes for it to image, putting it back in and booting it up!</p>
<p>We use USB to Hard Drive adapters so we can image from a laptop to any type of drive. Many times around Milwaukee, we’ll be setting up a lab and they might already have computers that are just running slowly, so we’ll show up with a laptop and image the computers on site to save everyone time and keep reusing the same computers.</p>
<p>We are currently looking for a new open source solution for imaging drives, that includes allowing someone running a lab to easily reimage a computer without removing the hard drive or crawling through too many text based screens. We’d greatly appreciate any feedback on this matter.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything else you wish to share with us about your organization or how you use Xubuntu?</strong></p>
<p>Thank you to everybody who has contributed to the development and creation of Xubuntu, we really appreciate it and love using it! Your work is having a real impact, both on the environment and the lives of people in need.</p>
<p>If you’d like to contribute either hardware or money, we’re happily accepting both. We’re planning trips to Sierra Leone and Jamaica later this year, so we need all of the computers we can get! Currently, we are raising funds to move out of our small student org office space that MSOE has graciously given us and into a bigger space. <a href="http://www.projectcc.org/?page_id=1055">Details on how to donate can be found at our website.</a></p>
<p>If you think this is a great idea and you’d love to do it in your town, please contact us, we’d love to help you get started!</p>

   </ul>

   <p>After three Nights of Xubuntu, the Xubuntu team is able to present you a quick overview of some of the planned features and improvements for Xubuntu 13.10. Enjoy!</p>
<h2 id="software-and-development">Software and development</h2>
<p>On the software side, <a href="http://apt-offline.alioth.debian.org/">apt-offline</a> will be included in our default installation after a few cycles of preparing and writing documentation for it. This will help our users who have impaired-bandwidth situations and usage documentation is already present in the 13.04 offline documentation. The team is also considering the possibility to add a <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Roadmap/Specifications/Quantal/KeyboardShortcutsOverlay">keyboard shortcuts overlay</a> to help new (and why not old) users with their shortcuts-fu. Finally, the team is looking to improve the Pavucontrol user interface to make it more intuitive.</p>
<p>The team also discussed if a heads-up display (HUD) would fit to the Xubuntu paradigm and if it would be viable to implement. The team decided that including or working with one should be postponed until after the long-term support (LTS) release since there isn’t a proof of concept of a HUD suitable for Xubuntu ready and developing one would take a lot of developer time. Further inquiry can take place, though.</p>
<p>Besides the additions and improvements to software, the team roughly discussed including a Xubuntu core meta package which would include only a basic system without various applications seen in the current default installation. Some team members are working on drafts for the contents for the package as you read this article. The meta package would be installable instead of the Xubuntu desktop package during installation.</p>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>The team is keeping the pressure up on the documentation improvements. The team is looking to extend the re-written Xubuntu documentation from a few releases ago even further as well as to get the infrastructure rights to enable translations for the documentation.</p>
<p>In addition, another goal is to get started with the 12.04 documentation review to supply a more up-to-date version via a stable release update for the LTS users as well.</p>
<h2 id="community">Community</h2>
<p>As with the previous cycles, we will keep on focusing on community. One of our targets this cycle is to get several people new upload rights to the Xubuntu package set. We also hope the prospective developers can help create processes with the <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/xubuntu-devel/2013-May/008881.html">newly appointed QA team lead</a> to help reinforce the QA team as well as help with their testing duties.</p>
<h2 id="milestone-participation">Milestone participation</h2>
<p>As usually, Xubuntu is following the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SaucySalamander/ReleaseSchedule" title="Ubuntu release schedule for Saucy Salamander">Ubuntu release schedule</a>. While the release schedule is far from final, the Xubuntu team is planning to release one alpha and both betas. At the moment the alpha participation looks pretty certain but the details depend on the Xfce 4.12 release. We will keep sending updates as soon as we have any news.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In the end, this is a final tune-up before we head into developing the LTS release that is expected to be unleashed in April 2014. Xubuntu presents a conservative desktop choice among the Ubuntu flavours. As we head into the Saucy Salamander development cycle, we will be striving for excellence once more.</p>

   <p>Due to the size of the Xubuntu ISOs starting from Raring (13.04), they no longer fit on a standard CD. This guide will help you if your BIOS doesn&rsquo;t support booting off of USB drives by showing you how to use <a href="http://www.plop.at/">Plop</a> boot manager.</p>
<h3 id="getting-plop">Getting Plop</h3>
<p>You can download the most recent version <a href="http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanager/download.html">here</a> (plpbt-*).</p>
<h3 id="executing-plop">Executing Plop</h3>
<p>The burning process is similar as documented on the <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto">Ubuntu wiki</a>.</p>
<p>Main contents of the downloaded archive should be:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>1README.TXT  Instructional Readme.
plpbt.bin    Boot manager binary
plpbt.img    Boot manager floppy disk image
plpbt.iso    Boot manager CD ISO
plpbtrom.bin Boot manager ROM file for the BIOS

doc/          Documentation
experimental/ Experimental versions
pcmcia/       PCMCIA version of the boot manager
Linux/        Linux related programs
Windows/      Windows related programs
</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>You will then have to create your bootable USB device (flash drive) as documented in the <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick">installation section</a> of the Ubuntu wiki.</p>
<p>After you create both the bootable USB device and Plop CD, place the CD in the CD drive, and power off the computer. After you power off, place the USB device in the computer and turn the computer on, you may need to go into the BIOS settings and configure it to boot from CD first.</p>

        <img src="http://localhost:1313/news/2013/booting-the-xubuntu-usb-image-from-a-cd/plop-menu.png"/> </figure>

<p>After you boot into Plop from the CD, you should see a “USB” item on the menu that will appear (as pictured to the right), select it with the Down arrow key, then hit Enter to boot.</p>
<p>If everything has gone as expected, Xubuntu live desktop should boot from USB. Enjoy!</p>

   <p>It&rsquo;s again the time to call for more testers – Xubuntu Raring beta 1 is around.</p>
<h2 id="why-help-with-testing">Why help with testing?</h2>
<p>Testing is an excellent and easy way to get involved with Xubuntu. It’s a vital part of our release cycle and anyone with a virtual machine (or even better, a spare computer!) can help out with it. When you do testing you will work with most of the people involved in Xubuntu. Don&rsquo;t be afraid, we won&rsquo;t bite you!</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-need-to-do">What do I need to do?</h2>
<p>There are different ways of testing the ISOs for all of our releases. Here&rsquo;s a quick overview of the different tests we need to run:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Installation testing</strong> to make sure our ISO&rsquo;s are installable</li>
<li><strong>Live CD testing</strong> to make sure the live CD environment works as expected (and to make sure persistency works on live USB)</li>
<li><strong>Post-installation testing</strong> to make sure our applications work as expected</li>
<li><strong>Upgrade testing</strong> to make sure upgrades from old releases work as expected</li>
</ol>
<p>All the results from different tests are reported and recorded on the <a href="http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu ISO Tracker</a>. You will need a Ubuntu Single Sign-On account to log in and send results.</p>
<p>Finally, to run a test and report it so it helps the Xubuntu team, you need to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu ISO Tracker</a> and Log in</li>
<li>Click <strong>Raring Beta 1</strong> and select your infrastructure from the <strong>Xubuntu</strong> product at the bottom of the page</li>
<li>Download the appropriate ISO (see <strong>Link to download information</strong> at the top of the page for download links as well as zsync commands)</li>
<li>Select a test you want to run – it&rsquo;s best to start with an installation test and then advance to post-installation tests to get the most out of your time</li>
<li>On any test page, you should see the testcase instructions (if you don&rsquo;t, click on <strong>Testcase</strong>) and follow them step by step</li>
<li>If you find bugs while running the test, add them to the report and if they don&rsquo;t exist, <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs">file them</a></li>
<li>In the <strong>Bugs to look for</strong> section you will see bugs that people have been experiencing with the same test before – specifically look out for these</li>
<li>Once you&rsquo;ve finished with the testcase, <strong>report your results</strong>; select the overall <strong>result</strong> for the test and list any <strong>bugs</strong> you experienced during testing. Remember to click <strong>Submit result</strong> when you&rsquo;re done – <em>if you don&rsquo;t do this, the Xubuntu team doesn&rsquo;t get any benefit from the test!</em></li>

   <p>The Xubuntu team had an extra meeting on Monday to discuss and decide a possible move to a bigger ISO size and other important issues for Raring.</p>
<p>After a thorough discussion, which included the obvious drawback that will no longer fit on a CD and the amount of developer time currently spent keeping the ISO small enough to fit on a CD, the team decided that Xubuntu will have a 1GB ISO by clear vote of 8-0. The bigger ISO size will be featured starting from Raring, which is due to be released in April.</p>
<p>With this extra 300MB of space, the team has decided to reintroduce both Gnumeric spreadsheet application and GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) image editor, both of which were dropped for the 12.10 release due to space constraints. Discussion about reintroduction of more of the most popular language packs and extra artwork will continue on the IRC channel #xubuntu-devel and on the <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/xubuntu-devel">Xubuntu development mailing list</a> in the following weeks. As always, the team will adhere to the tenants of the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/StrategyDocument">Strategy Document</a> when discussing these changes and strive to not add things to the ISO just because space is available.</p>
<p>Full logs and minutes from our meeting are available on our wiki <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Meetings/Archive/Minutes/2013-02-11-isosize">here</a>.</p>

   </ul>

   <p>Welcome! To provide a better experience to all the Xubuntu users we gather what we consider to be common questions any user might come to find.</p>
<p>We have been doing this for the last few releases, check the previous FAQ to find out interesting and probably helpful information about your system.</p>
<p>In this particular release of Xubuntu we have moved out of Xfce 4.8, into the most recent 4.10, this carries some issues when updating that we would like to help you overcome:</p>
<h3 id="1-after-upgrading-to-xubuntu-1210-my-panel-icons-are-all-group-together-to-one-side-of-the-panel-how-do-i-make-them-occupy-the-whole-of-it">1. After upgrading to Xubuntu 12.10 my panel icons are all group together to one side of the panel, how do I make them occupy the whole of it?</h3>
<p>This happens because of some changes on the xfce 4.10 panel structures, you need to <em>add a separator item</em> to the panel and set it to <em>expand</em> to fix this issue.</p>
<h3 id="2-where-did-the-messaging-menu-go">2. Where did the messaging menu go?</h3>
<p>Due to constraints unavoidable by the Xubuntu team the messaging menu is not available in Xubuntu 12.10, you must use Xubuntu 12.04 if you wish to have this menu/indicator.</p>
<h3 id="3-i-dont-see-my-sound-indicator-anymore-how-do-i-get-it-back">3. I don&rsquo;t see my sound indicator anymore, how do I get it back?</h3>
<p>Right-click on a blank area of the panel and select <em>Panel <strong>»</strong> Add New Items&hellip;</em> Find the Indicator Plugin in the list, select it and click the &ldquo;Add&rdquo; button.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Use <em>Panel <strong>»</strong> Panel Preferences&hellip; <strong>»</strong> Items</em> to move it to a location of your preferences.</p>
<h3 id="4-duplicated-partitions-are-shown-in-the-thunar-sidebar-and-the-desktop">4. Duplicated partitions are shown in the Thunar sidebar and the desktop</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, this is a known bug for some users. There is a fix in the -proposed repository, which you may enable in the Software Center and upgrade thunar to the new version.</p>
<p><em>Warning:</em> This archive is &ldquo;proposed&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s now available for testing, it is not yet a fully-tested part of the system and may have packages that are unstable.</p>
<h3 id="5-alternate-images-are-no-longer-available-how-do-i-install-xubuntu-with-the-text-installer">5. Alternate images are no longer available, how do I install Xubuntu with the text installer?</h3>
<p>Use the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Core">ubuntu-core</a> image and choose the selection for installing Xubuntu.</p>
<h3 id="6-when-i-drag-a-window-to-the-upper-border-of-the-screen-it-resizes-to-the-width-of-the-screen-and-half-its-height-how-do-i-prevent-this">6. When I drag a window to the upper border of the screen, it resizes to the width of the screen and half its height, how do I prevent this?</h3>
<p>This is a new feature in Xfce 4.10, which is included in Xubuntu 12.10. To disable this, go into <em>Settings Manager <strong>»</strong> Window Manager Tweaks <strong>»</strong> Accessibility</em> and uncheck &ldquo;Automatically tile windows when moving toward the screen edge&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="7-how-do-i-search-for-proprietary-drivers-available-on-my-system">7. How do I search for proprietary drivers available on my system?</h3>
<p>In order to enable proprietary drivers which are packaged for Xubuntu, you open the Ubuntu Software Center and go to <em>Edit <strong>»</strong> Software Sources <strong>»</strong> Additional Drivers</em>. This will allow you to select which drivers you wish to use.</p>
<h3 id="8-thunar-loads-very-slowly-on-first-launch-how-do-i-fix-that">8. Thunar loads very slowly on first launch, how do I fix that?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, this is a <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/thunar/+bug/775117">known bug</a>. See <a href="http://xubuntu.org/news/faq-1204-precise/">FAQ for Xubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin</a> for more on how to work around this.</p>
<h3 id="9-is-there-a-way-to-use-folders-shared-from-windows">9. Is there a way to use folders shared from Windows?</h3>
<p>Yes, using Gigolo. See <a href="http://xubuntu.org/news/faq-1204-precise/">FAQ for Xubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin</a> for more.</p>

   <p>When you go to &ldquo;Help&rdquo; in the main menu in Xubuntu Firefox will launch and bring you to an offline documentation page where users can learn the basics.</p>
<p>After a couple of cycles without updates, the Xubuntu team worked hard this cycle to take a fresh look at the documentation. The team spent time reorganizing the structure, updating to reflect current default applications and in many cases completely rewriting whole sections. The look was also refreshed to reflect the current style and branding that the project has adopted.</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="http://localhost:1313/news/releases/12.10/offline-documentation-rewritten-for-12-10/xubuntu_docs_1210.png"/> </figure>

<p>The team would like to formally thank the following volunteers who made this effort possible:</p>
<p>Pasi Lallinaho (knome) for leading up the effort in lieu of a formal Documentation Lead this cycle. Pasi also contributed directly to the documentation itself, tracked reviews, updated documentation branding, converted everything back into DocBook and worked with the Ubuntu Doc team to get the documentation uploaded and released before the documentation freeze.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Krumbach (lyz) for setting up, hosting and maintaining the wiki that was used by the team during the rewrite and coordinating some of the work between volunteers and the Ubuntu Doc team.</p>
<p>Sean Davis (smd-seandavis), Jack Fromm (jjfrv8-gmail), Kev (elfy) and Jay van Cooten (skippersboss) for their extensive edits both the writing of the documentation and efforts during the rushed review process.</p>
<h2 id="but-thats-not-all">But that&rsquo;s not all&hellip;</h2>
<p>The work of a documentation writer is never truly finished! The team has already defined several areas where we&rsquo;d like to improve upon the documentation for the 13.04 cycle, including: improvements to packaging, translations support, routine documentation review and expanding some of the shorter sections.</p>
<p>To see the complete and current list of things we are planning to improve even further, see <a href="https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/other-r-xubuntu-docs">our documentation blueprint for the R cycle</a>. If you want to help us with the planning, want to take part in the discussion or want to get your hands dirty when it&rsquo;s time to work again, subscribe to the blueprint, apply to the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~xubuntu-doc">xubuntu-doc Launchpad team</a> and be in touch with us (see the <a href="http://xubuntu.org/contribute/">starting points at Get Involved</a>)!</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t have any major changes from the Alpha2, but there are a few known issues you should be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are no alternate images for this release</li>
<li>The image is still oversized for 700M CDs (see related bugs: <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1028486">1028486</a>, <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1029552">1029552</a>), please use a USB stick, DVD or other method for installing these oversized images</li>
<li>All applications using Gtk3 currently have some mismatched colors in menus and buttons because of a bug in the Unico engine (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1016713">1016713</a>). A fix has been applied upstream but has not yet made it to Xubuntu.</li>

   <p>In the past year the Xubuntu project has gone from zero to four social media outlets for sharing our project updates, news and discussions. All of these resources are linked at the bottom of every page on Xubuntu.org.</p>
<p>The most exceptional thing about this experience is that not only did three of the four outlets <em>already exist</em> as fan-created sites, all three of these admins where delighted to add a member of the Xubuntu leadership team as an admin and have their page made Official by the project. As our intention was to not only reach more users through these resources, but also to involve more people in the project, for each of these resources we&rsquo;ve asked them to keep on running the groups as they used to.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://twitter.com/Xubuntu">Twitter</a></strong></p>
<p>This is the only social media account that we created. Currently project lead Pasi Lallinaho and I work to keep it updated.</p>

<p>This was a page created by Knez Nenc and diligently maintained with not only Xubuntu.org news, but other news related to news around Xubuntu&rsquo;s default applications and reviews about Xubuntu.</p>

         Xubuntu&#39;s default theme gets a refresh for Quantal
      </a>
   </h1>

   </ul>

   <p>While we&rsquo;ve been using &ldquo;Greybird&rdquo; as our default theme for a few releases now, I&rsquo;ve continuously worked on it. The goal was not only to ensure the quality of the theme in terms of a flawless Xfce4 and Gtk3 performance and extras like supporting Unity or Compiz, but also to visually keep it up-to-date.</p>
<h3 id="more-contrast">More contrast</h3>
<p>After having had a tendency to soften colors and contrasts, I&rsquo;ve decided to take a (bold?) step and counter this tendency. This is why the changes for the upcoming Quantal release might seem more drastic then between the releases before. After playing with it for a while, I realized that going this direction half-way wouldn&rsquo;t work well, so while I&rsquo;m aware that there might be quite a bit of whining (partly because people may miss the &ldquo;old Greybird&rdquo;, partly because change always provokes whining) I really hope that many and most of you will fall in love with the changes the way I did while working on it.</p>
<h3 id="built-around-gtk2">Built around Gtk2</h3>
<p>Since the Xfce developer community decided a while ago not to port their (and consequently: our) desktop to Gtk3 in the next release (4.12) and instead to postpone that until performance and memory issues with Gtk3 would be fixed (keeping my fingers crossed), I built the refresh of Greybird around Gtk2. As this will be the main platform for our users&rsquo; desktop experience, I&rsquo;ll try my best to port all the changes to Gtk3 as perfectly as possible, so that hopefully no-one will notice whether an app is Gtk2 or Gtk3 (because I firmly believe that users <em>shouldn&rsquo;t</em> have to care about things like that).</p>
<p>So, without much further ado and blathering, here goes a representational compilation for our Greybird refresh.</p>

   <p>It is the <strong>time to submit your ideas</strong> on how to make Xubuntu better: the brainstorming phase for the 12.10 roadmap is on now! It is also a good <strong>time to start contributing</strong>, since every item needs an assignee – without assignees, even good ideas will not be approved – thus not implemented.</p>
<p>Everybody is welcome to submit ideas to the roadmap brainstorm until the end of week 19 (13th of May). To do this, edit the table in the section <em>New features, major bugs, improvements to community</em> on the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Roadmap/Goals/Quantal">roadmap page for Quantal</a>. Please add new ideas to the end of the table so it is easier to follow submissions.</p>
<p>If you are willing to <strong>implement a feature</strong> too (or work on an item when &ldquo;implementing&rdquo; is not applicable), you can add yourself to the assignee field on any item with no assignee, including your own submission. Please note that the default application specifications will need assignees as well. Feel free to add yourself as an assignee to any of these too, even if they had an assignee already – multiple assignees will most probably lead to better objectivity.</p>
<p>If you set yourself as assignee to any item and are not an active member in the Xubuntu community, please send an email to the <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/xubuntu-devel">Xubuntu development mailing list</a> to introduce yourself quickly. Unless we hear from assignees before the end of week 20 (20th of May), ideas will not be approved anyway. Approving will happen during week 20 by the Xubuntu team.</p>

   </ul>

   <h3 id="1-is-there-a-way-to-use-folders-shared-from-windows">1. Is there a way to use folders shared from Windows?</h3>
<p>Yes, using Gigolo. If you are not able to see the network check if <code>gvfs-backends</code> is installed.</p>
<h3 id="2-thunar-loads-very-slowly-on-first-launch-how-do-i-fix-that">2. Thunar loads very slowly on first launch, how do I fix that?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, this is a <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/thunar/+bug/775117">known bug</a>. There are two possible solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit the file <code>/usr/share/gvfs/mounts/network.mount</code> (as root) and change <code>AutoMount</code> to <code>false</code>. This disables the Network browsing when Thunar starts up, but still lets you mount network storage such as Samba shares on demand. Please note that this solution leaves you with a broken &ldquo;Network&rdquo; link in Thunar.</li>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t use Samba (Windows shares), remove <code>gvfs-backends</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-i-cant-resize-windows-because-the-window-borders-are-too-tiny">3. I can&rsquo;t resize windows because the window borders are too tiny!</h3>
<p>The suggested way to resize windows is to hold the Alt key, right-click somewhere inside the window and drag to resize. See <a href="http://xubuntu.org/news/window-resizing-in-xubuntu-and-xfce/" title="Window resizing in Xubuntu (and Xfce)">Window resizing in Xubuntu (and Xfce)</a> for all the different methods.</p>
<h3 id="4-is-there-a-way-to-use-dropbox-with-thunar">4. Is there a way to use Dropbox with Thunar?</h3>
<p>There is an unofficial and unsupported <a href="http://softwarebakery.com/maato/thunar-dropbox.html">plugin for Dropbox on Thunar</a>.</p>
<p>To compile the package, you need to install <code>libthunarx-2-dev</code>. In addition, you need to install <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/install?os=lnx">Dropbox</a> as well as start the daemon installation with <code>dropbox start -i</code>. Please note that this will install the propietary Dropbox daemon. Running this command will also start a wizard to set up your Dropbox account, including a possibility to create one.</p>
<h3 id="5-how-do-i-configure-multiple-monitors">5. How do I configure multiple monitors?</h3>
<p>To set up and configure multiple monitors and/or other output devices you can use arandr, which is a simple drag-and-drop front-end for xrandr.</p>
<p>If you are using the propietary Nvidia driver, you can use the <code>nvidia-settings</code> tool.</p>
<h3 id="6-installing-package-x-installs-a-lot-of-other-packages">6. Installing package X installs a lot of other packages!</h3>
<p>There is a way to stop installing the so-called &ldquo;recommends&rdquo; packages automatically. For single packages, you should use the <code>--no-install-recommends</code> switch with <code>apt-get</code>. To turn off installing recommends for all packages, do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Synaptic, go to Settings <strong>»</strong> Preferences <strong>»</strong> tab General and uncheck &ldquo;Consider recommended packages as dependencies&rdquo;</li>
<li>Create the file <code>/usr/apt/apt.conf.d/05norecommends</code> and add the following line in the file: <code>APT::Install-Recommends &quot;false&quot;;</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-how-do-i-disable-guest-login-how-do-i-enable-autologin">7. How do I disable guest login? How do I enable autologin?</h3>
<p>Edit the file <code>/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf;</code></p>
<ul>
<li>To disable guest login, set <code>allow-guest</code> to <code>false</code></li>
<li>To enable autologin, edit the file to look like this: [SeatDefaults] autologin-user=&lt;USERNAME&gt; autologin-user-timeout=0 user-session=xubuntu greeter-session=lightdm-gtk-greeter</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-how-can-i-edit-the-applications-menu">8. How can I edit the applications menu?</h3>
<p>Xubuntu 12.04 has the Alacarte menu editor installed by default. You can launch it from Applications menu <strong>»</strong> Settings <strong>»</strong> Main menu.</p>
<h3 id="9-my-theme-shows-white-text-on-light-background-help">9. My theme shows white text on light background. Help!</h3>
<p>You are most probably using the <a href="http://shimmerproject.org/project/albatross/">Albatross</a> theme. Unfortunately, this theme is not updated yet to fully support GTK3. There is a bug about this (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/shimmer-themes/+bug/989814">LP #989814</a>) with an attached patch which provides a quick workaround, too.</p>
<p>For the best GTK3 support, we advise to use the <a href="http://shimmerproject.org/project/greybird/">Greybird</a> theme, which is the default for Xubuntu 12.04.</p>
<h2 id="still-having-issues">Still having issues?</h2>
<p>Please see the earlier <a href="http://xubuntu.org/news/category/faq/">FAQ articles</a> on our website.

         Xubuntu Artwork Update: Unity Support

   </ul>

   <p>While there are many people who project a competition between Ubuntu and its flavors, I&rsquo;d like to set a (small) sign that this is definitely not the case.</p>
<p>With respect to our default theme, &ldquo;Greybird&rdquo;, I have been striving to expand the supported window-managers in the last release &ldquo;Oneiric Ocelot, 11.10&rdquo; (metacity, emerald), to give people who want to use Compiz in Xubuntu an easy way to use our default look.</p>
<p>So for this cycle (&ldquo;Precise Pangolin&rdquo;) I started working on adding <em>support for Unity in Greybird</em>. Unfortunately there were so many things to do in the artwork-department during this cycle that I could only start a very short while ago, so we&rsquo;re far past the freezes. So far our testers report that things are working well and if there are no blockers coming up, this will hopefully land in Precise via the -proposed repository.</p>
<h3 id="try-for-yourself">Try for yourself!</h3>
<p>You can try this version of Greybird even before it lands in any repository very easily by <a href="https://github.com/shimmerproject/Greybird/tarball/v0.8.1" title="Greybird 0.8.1 via Github">downloading the 0.8.1 release</a> and unpacking the theme into ~/.themes (if that directory doesn&rsquo;t exist, simply create it).</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is currently no built-in way of switching to any other than the short list of themes that Ubuntu ships by default in Unity, so those of you who want to give this a try will have to use something like &ldquo;GNOME Tweak Tool&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ubuntu Tweak&rdquo; or &ldquo;My Unity&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If you find any bugs please <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/shimmer-themes/+bugs" title="File a bug on launchpad against Greybird">file them on launchpad</a>! Thanks in advance and happy testing!</p>

   <p>For quite a while now there has been questions about resizing windows in Xfce, especially with theme with narrow window-borders. Usually people would ask for wider window-borders, but there are several methods of resizing a window and the thin borders in Xubuntu&rsquo;s current default theme Greybird are not as much of a usability issue as some suggest.</p>
<h2 id="the-five-methods">The five methods</h2>
<h3 id="method-1-using-the-resize-grip">Method 1: Using the resize grip</h3>
<p>Resize grips (usually small triangles) are positioned in the bottom right corner of a window, often as part of a statusbar. Before 12.04 (Precise Pangolin), Ubuntu had patched Gtk2 to add these resize grips to <em>all</em> applications. This would allow people to easily grab each window and resize it, even with theme with thin borders.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this patch had some regressions; for example, clicking OpenOffice&rsquo;s resize grip would open the file menu. The regressions made Ubuntu developers drop the feature from 12.04. Starting from 12.04, Gtk2 applications will have to use one of the other resizing methods for applications that don&rsquo;t have a built-in resize grip. All the Gtk3 applications will have a resize grip in Greybird (Xubuntu&rsquo;s default theme).</p>
<h3 id="method-2-alt--right-click--drag">Method 2: Alt + right-click + drag</h3>
<p>This is maybe the easiest and most useful way of resizing windows. I&rsquo;m tempted to say that once you got accustomed to this it&rsquo;s hard to go back. Simply hold the Alt key, right-click somewhere inside the window and drag to resize. It works intriguingly well and is a very nice complement to the easiest way of moving windows: holding Alt and left-click drag.</p>
<h3 id="method-3-keyboard-shortcut">Method 3: Keyboard shortcut</h3>
<p>Xfwm4, Xfce&rsquo;s window manager, supports a number of keyboard shortcuts (which can be edited by going to the Settings Manager &gt; Window Manager &gt; Keyboard). One of them is for resizing windows with your keyboard. There is currently no keyboard shortcut set by default, but you can set one in the Window Manager dialog.</p>
<p>As soon as your keyboard-shortcut (in Xfce upstream its Alt+F8) is hit, you can then resize the window by either moving your mouse (no need to click or drag) or use your keyboard arrow keys.</p>
<h3 id="method-4-using-the-top-corners-of-a-window">Method 4: Using the top corners of a window</h3>
<p>While the resize grip has been removed from Gtk2 in Ubuntu and isn&rsquo;t present in every application, you can always resize windows by using the two top corners with the mouse. In most Xfwm4 themes the area of the top corners is large enough to easily grab and drag it with the mouse.</p>
<h3 id="method-5-using-the-window-menu">Method 5: Using the window-menu</h3>
<p>You can also initiate the same action as proposed in <strong>Method 3</strong> above via the window-menu. Accessing the window-menu works either by clicking the menu-button in your window-titlebar (if your Xfwm4 theme has one), or by simply right-clicking the titlebar. There&rsquo;s also a keyboard-shortcut to access the window-menu, but if you only want to resize the window, it&rsquo;s easier to use the direct shortcut for that (again, see <strong>Method 3</strong>).</p>

<h2 id="our-new-branding">Our new branding</h2>
<p>Along with the Beta 2 release of Xubuntu, we are proudly presenting our new branding, including a brand new and shiny logo, refreshed website looks and the few-days-old wallpaper for Precise. Our website also includes a page for <a href="http://xubuntu.org/marketingresources/" title="Marketing Resources">Xubuntu marketing resources</a>, including PNG and SVG versions of the new logo as well as some shiny, new web banners for public use.</p>
<h3 id="without-further-babble-our-new-logo-in-all-its-glory">Without further babble, our new logo in all its glory</h3>

<figure>
    
        <img src="http://localhost:1313/news/releases/12.04/beta-2-released-new-branding/logo-2012.png" alt="Xubuntu logo, 2012 version. Light and dark background versions."/> <figcaption>
                <p>
                    Xubuntu logo, 2012 version. Light and dark background versions.
                    
                        
                        </p>
                
            </figcaption></figure>

<p>The new logo has a more condensed look and features a more saturated blue. To avoid being superfluous on blue, the logotype is printed on dark grey. It can also be easily replaced with white on darker backgrounds.</p>
<p>The picmark is still based on the <a href="http://xfce.org/">Xfce</a> mouse, but it&rsquo;s more simplified and designed to work better in different contexts and sizes. While the picmark has lost some similarity with the Xfce mouse, reducing the complexity is a logical step from the last logo change.</p>
<h3 id="xubuntu-precise-wallpaper-a-better-experience-for-dual-head-users">Xubuntu Precise wallpaper: a better experience for dual-head users</h3>
<p>The new wallpaper consists of two parts to give dual-head users a better experience with default wallpapers for once. Here&rsquo;s the wallpaper in one, wide piece.</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="http://localhost:1313/news/releases/12.04/beta-2-released-new-branding/precise-wallpaper.png" alt="Xubuntu Precise wallpaper"/> <figcaption>
                <p>
                    Xubuntu Precise wallpaper
                    
                        
                        </p>
                
            </figcaption></figure>

<p>As some of you notice, the wallpaper has lots of elements previously seen on the Xubuntu wallpapers. That&rsquo;s right, it&rsquo;s intentional. Time to give some homage for the old times. We don&rsquo;t want to go too rusty or dusty, so there&rsquo;s some nice green stuff in, too.</p>
<p>The right side of the wallpaper with the flying bird will be the default wallpaper. If you don&rsquo;t like birds, rather just watch a more plain wallpaper, need to set a wallpaper to the other monitor too or just for fun: we encourage you to try out the left side too!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no certainty that we will keep on providing these wide wallpapers in the future releases, so starting from now is the right time to give feedback. Do you love it? Do you hate it? Should every operating system provide such wallpapers? Should we stick to providing one wallpaper only to keep the decision-making to a minimum?

   </ul>

   <p><strong>Xubuntu Beta 2 is coming out this week and we need testers!</strong></p>
<p>Testing is an excellent way to get involved with Xubuntu. It&rsquo;s a vital part of our release cycle and anyone with a virtual machine (or even better, a spare computer!) can help out with it.</p>
<p>The Xubuntu community maintains extensive documents related to testing, we highly recommend you browse through these as you get more involved with testing:</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Testing">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Testing</a></p>
<p><em>But as a quick start&hellip;</em></p>
<p>Testing Xubuntu is made up of two key sections:</p>
<p>The <strong>Xubuntu <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Testing/TestingInfo">Testing Info</a></strong> page, explaining more about the testing process, including which tests you should conduct.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Testing/TestingInfo/Short">Short Test</a> page, containing specific instructions on how to perform a basic test of Xubuntu. This page includes procedures for both the desktop cd and post-install testing.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Testing/TestingInfo/Long">Long Test</a> page, containing instructions on how to perform a more thorough test of Xubuntu.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The <a href="http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/build/xubuntu/all">QA ISO Testing Tracker</a></strong> page, where testers should report their ISO test results.</p>
<ul>
<li>This tracker is used by both the Ubuntu Release Manager and Ubuntu QA to determine which images will be released for any given milestone.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two testing methods are typically used in tandem, but when you&rsquo;re just starting out you can &ldquo;get your feet wet&rdquo; by trying what you&rsquo;re most comfortable with. You may notice that our testing document document includes more fine-tuned distinctions between <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Testing/TestingInfo#Daily_images_and_Milestone_releases">Daily images and Milestone releases</a> with specific tests we ask people do for each which will help determine whether we&rsquo;re moving forward with a specific milestone release.</p>
<p>To do either of these, you’ll first want to download the ISO as documented on the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Testing/TestingInfo">Testing Info</a> page.</p>
<p>Once you have your .iso file:</p>
<ul>
<li>Burn it to a CD-ROM</li>
<li>Put it on a USB stick (try usb-creator-gtk or UNetbootin)</li>
<li>Use the ISO to load up a new virtual machine in VirtualBox (or similar)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you can select what tests you wish to run. Can you do an install to test the ISO on the <a href="http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/build/xubuntu/all">QA ISO Testing Tracker</a>? Or perhaps just do a live session where you do a <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Testing/TestingInfo/Short">Short Test</a>?</p>
<p>While doing these tests it is important to <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs">file bugs</a>. If you find a bug, please, search if it has already been reported, and if it hasn&rsquo;t, report it yourself. You should also refer to the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingProcedures">debugging guide</a> for that specific package (if available) to make sure you are aware of known issues and have attached the relevant log files.</p>
<p>Have any trouble? Have any questions? Not sure where to report a bug, or if it’s a bug? Join us in #xubuntu-devel on irc.freenode.net (use a client, or access via your browser <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=xubuntu-devel">here</a>) or on the <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/xubuntu-devel">xubuntu-devel mailing list</a>. Please be patient when using either of these resources, our team is small so it may take us some time to respond.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

   <p>After a long, long wait and much hard work, we are ready to proudly present the new Xubuntu website!</p>
<h2 id="new-looks">New looks</h2>
<p>The appearance is updated and more sleek, clean, professional, informative, beautiful and representative. It&rsquo;s easier to navigate on the site. The header area is less obtrusive. Generally speaking, you get faster to the content. We are also <strong>finally</strong> using our new branding.</p>
<h2 id="the-long-awaited-migration">The long-awaited migration</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve switched from Drupal to <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a> under the hood. We are no longer depending on any hacks, neither in the technical side or the appearance side. Administration is easier, which will hopefully result in more frequently updated website. The Xubuntu website team is also much more familiar with WordPress than Drupal, so working the site technically should be much easier in the future as well. The theme was hand-built from scratch, so we do know how to work with that as well. Even in the case we needed to extend or update it.</p>
<h2 id="the-most-important-thing--content">The most important thing – content</h2>
<p>The site is undergoing a massive review of content and content-related issues as well. These things include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hand-picked <a href="http://www.xubuntu.org/news/faq-1110-oneiric/">Frequently Asked Questions -article</a> (and the <a href="http://www.xubuntu.org/news/tag/faq/">FAQ-category</a>), which covers all the most frequently asked questions and will be updated for each release</li>
<li><a href="http://www.xubuntu.org/developertools/">Developer tools</a>, which presents you all the useful tools to get started or keep going with Xubuntu development</li>
<li>Article browsing on the sidebar</li>
<li>Up-to-date screenshots</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;re really sorry that we aren&rsquo;t able to present you all the fruits of the content-reviewing process. While it would have been optimal to release the new website with all-new or at least all-reviewed content, it was more sensible to release what we have now, and fix the rest of the site later. This being said, if you notice any issues in the content, or are willing to help us work on it, please contact us. The best way is to <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/xubuntu-website/+filebug">file a bug</a> or send email to our <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/xubuntu-devel">developer mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, thanks to the following people who helped make this happen: Pasi Lallinaho (knome), Elizabeth Krumbach (pleia2), madnick, Bruno A. Benitez (GridCube), Simon Steinbeiß (ochosi), Phil Whitaker (beardygnome), Unit193, Steve Dodier (SiDi) and all the others who helped us testing the site or gave any feedback.</p>

   <h3 id="1-i-cant-hear-a-sound-how-can-i-get-my-sound-back">1. I can’t hear a sound. How can I get my sound back?</h3>
<p>There are many reasons why sound can be lost on a system, most of them if you try to use different audio protocols. The usual way to get sound back is to run <code>sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart</code>.</p>
<p>If this doesn’t work you can try running <code>sudo alsa force-unload</code> and <code>sudo alsa force-reload</code>.</p>
<p>Pulseaudio can sometimes cause conflicts with ALSA. If you are sure you don’t need one or the other, you could try purging pulseaudio with <code>sudo apt-get purge pulseaudio</code>.</p>
<p>If you still have problems please join the forums or IRC channels and feel free to ask all the questions you need.</p>

   </ul>

   <p>The first beta release of Xubuntu 11.10 &ldquo;Oneiric Ocelot&rdquo; has arrived. The developers are working hard to make Xubuntu 11.10 one of the best Linux distributions yet. They are striving to ensure that everything will work for all users, and instead of many changes, are working to ensure the release is very stable and secure.</p>
<p>This is still a testing build designed for developers and is not suggested for anyone looking for a stable system. Please do not install Oneiric Ocelot on your production system.</p>
<p><em>Changes (since Alpha 1 - Xubuntu specific):</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Xubuntu has replaced gdm with lightdm as the application that manages logins. Automatic logins will not work with lightdm at the present time. We are sure lightdm is going to provide a much better experience for the users than gdm.</li>
<li>Pastebinit is now included in Xubuntu intallations by default. If you need to use <a href="http://paste.ubuntu.com/">http://paste.ubuntu.com/</a>, you can use pastebinit to paste directly without copying and pasting the data.</li>
<li>The developers have replaced mousepad with leafpad as the text editor. leafpad now includes the ability to print, and is better maintained than mousepad.</li>
<li>The onscreen keyboard, Onboard, is now included in the default Xubuntu menus, under Accessories. For those who require an onscreen keyboard, this will be much easier to access using only a mouse or touchpad.</li>
<li>Astute users will observe a new plymouth splash screen in use. Unfortunately, we have found that occasionally, when using the desktop cd to install, the message &ldquo;hit any key to continue&rdquo; will not appear. Should you get a black screen with text and the sliding throbber, when the throbber stops moving and the cd ejects, remove the cd and hit enter on the keyboard to continue.</li>
<li>Bluetooth does not work at the present time in Xubuntu. Please see the bug below. A workaround is to install &lsquo;blueman&rsquo; to manage bluetooth.</li>
<li>The Xubuntu developers and contributors had a discussion about replacing the Gimp with an application to assist with digital photos. As a result, gThumb has been added to the default installation. This application is designed to help with image transformations and viewing.</li>
<li>(Users must select a session when logging in the first time. If no session is selected, the user will see the Ubuntu wallpaper, and nothing else. In this case, go to a tty using Ctrl+Alt+F2, login, and type: sudo service lightdm restart Now the user can login again, and select the session.)</li>

   <p>As one of Xubuntu&rsquo;s artwork contributors and member of the <a href="http://www.shimmerproject.org">Shimmerproject</a> I would like to take some time now - towards the end of this cycle - and discuss (at least parts of) the design process during the development phase for Natty (11.04). This is planned as a <em>review</em> and in a way (implicitely) a <em>preview</em>: you can see the direction Xubuntu is heading for since Maverick and Natty and hopefully the project will continue this way.</p>
<h3 id="looking-back-on-the-previous-release-aka-maverick">Looking back on the previous release (aka Maverick)</h3>
<p>We started out in early November to analyze what had happened during the Maverick cycle and I realized that with a few aspects of that particular cycle I was really unhappy. For one we started out with developing Bluebird (Maverick&rsquo;s new theme, which was designed as a bright pendant to the well-proven Albatross) very late and also other changes (mostly icons) were done at the last minute. Therefore we didn&rsquo;t have time to (<strong>1</strong>) go through sufficient testing and (<strong>2</strong>) gather feedback to evaluate and fine-tune the theme. Other than that the cooperation with the Xubuntu team worked fine, although I think we didn&rsquo;t communicate enough.</p>
<h3 id="evaluating-the-current-cycle-aka-natty">Evaluating the current cycle (aka Natty)</h3>
<p>In Natty we started pretty early, basically shortly after Maverick was released in late October of 2010 and I continuously developed <em>&ldquo;Greybird&rdquo;</em>, which is code-wise and experience-wise based on <em>Bluebird</em>. We got a lot of feedback from the community that suggested that the blue tones were too intense and in general the reactions were polarizing (meaning: some really liked it, other really disliked it). Therefore I decided to take a different approach and start again with <em>less colors</em> (hence the codename &ldquo;Greybird&rdquo;) and see where we would get with that. Charlie (Xubuntu&rsquo;s Project Leader) decided already during Maverick that one focus of Natty development should be accessibility, in my approach for Greybird these <em>two motivations</em> (less colors for daily use, accessibility) played along very nicely. The whole development process was (at least semi-)public from the beginning, the members of the Xubuntu community provided feedback during the community-meetings and as we felt ready we went public and links and screenshots were published and discussed on various blogs.</p>
<p>Other than the <em>gtk-theme</em> we also did a new <em>xfwm4-theme</em> (based on the elementary-theme by the elementary Team) and decided to go for <em>bigger changes with the panels</em>, making use of the new functions we gained from Xfce4.8. There&rsquo;s now the top panel that traditionally shows the menu-button and system-tray, but now it also contains the list of open windows. So basically the functionality of the two panels has been merged into one. I think the <em>gain in vertical screen estate</em> will be appreciated by users of 16:10 or 16:9 resolutions. In the lower edge we decided to auto-hide the launcher panel, the applications we consider most important for a new user are only one click away with that. This panel is easily customizable, to create new launchers simply drag and drop them from either the menu, appfinder or /usr/share/applications in Thunar. Since the compositor is now switched on by default we can make use of the new panel&rsquo;s gorgeous alpha-transparency and the lower launcher-panel looks beautifully semi-transparent.</p>
<p>One more issue that we were able to fix because we started with artwork so early in the cycle is the <em>resize-grips</em>, which are now shown in practically every window. Since most other urgent things were fixed already it was possible for us to focus on that issue and solve it gracefully: we now have a beautiful and accessible resize-grip in Greybird.</p>
<h3 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h3>
<p>As most of you know the UI-freeze is still some time away, so some things are still in the move. I had more plans for Natty than I was (or will be) able to finish in time (some of those plans and ideas developed throughout the cycle though), so I hope we will take the time and improve our project management by one more step: adding a roadmap for Natty+1 shortly after the release in April.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="find-what-youre-looking-for-with-catfish">Find what you&rsquo;re looking for with Catfish</h4>
<p>With Xubuntu 8.10, you&rsquo;ll find an option to &ldquo;Search for Files&rdquo; in the Places menu. Clicking this will present you with the widely popular, light-weight search front-end called Catfish. Catfish enables you to quickly and easily search for your documents, music, pictures, videos, and more.</p>
<p>For the technically inclined, Catfish is a frontend for different search engines (daemons).</p>
<p>You can employ find, slocate, locate, doodle, tracker, beagle, strigi and pinot - what ever tickles your fancy!</p>
<h4 id="easily-manage-your-secrets">Easily manage your secrets</h4>
<p>Xubuntu 8.10 includes the well known secret keeper Seahorse. Seahorse is a GTK front end for GnuPG - the Gnu Privacy Guard program. It is a tool for secure communications and data storage. Data encryption and digital signature creation can easily be performed through a GUI and Key Management operations can easily be carried out through an intuitive interface.</p>
<h4 id="xorg-74">X.Org 7.4</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.x.org/wiki/Releases/7.4">X.Org 7.4</a>, the latest stable version of <a href="http://www.x.org/wiki/">X.Org</a>, is available in this version. This release brings much better support for hot-pluggable input devices such as tablets, keyboards, and mice. At the same time this will allow the great majority of users to run without a /etc/X11/xorg.conf file. A new failsafe X is introduced, to give better tools for troubleshooting X startup failures.</p>
<p>Two of the older nvidia binary drivers are not available for X.Org 7.4 yet, so users of these drivers will be automatically switched to the corresponding open source drivers.</p>
<h4 id="linux-kernel-2627">Linux kernel 2.6.27</h4>
<p>Xubuntu 8.10 includes Linux kernel 2.6.27, a significant release with better hardware support and numerous bug-fixes.</p>
<h4 id="encrypted-private-directory">Encrypted private directory</h4>
<p>The ecryptfs-utils package was recently promoted to Ubuntu main, with support for a <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EncryptedPrivateDirectory">secret encrypted folder</a> in your Home Folder (by Michael Halcrow, Dustin Kirkland, and Daniel Baumann).</p>
<h4 id="network-manager-07">Network Manager 0.7</h4>
<p>Xubuntu 8.10 ships Network Manager 0.7 (by Dan Williams and others), which comes with long-expected features, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>system wide settings (i.e., no need to log in in order to get a connection)</li>
<li>management of 3G connections (GSM/CDMA)</li>
<li>management of multiple active devices at once</li>
<li>management of PPP and PPPOE connections</li>
<li>management of devices with static IP configurations</li>

<h4 id="dkms">DKMS</h4>
<p><a href="http://linux.dell.com/dkms">DKMS</a> (by Dell) is included in Xubuntu 8.10, allowing kernel drivers to be automatically rebuilt when new kernels are released. This makes it possible for kernel package updates to be made available immediately without waiting for rebuilds of driver packages, and without third-party driver packages becoming out of date when installing these kernel updates.</p>
<h4 id="samba-32">Samba 3.2</h4>
<p>A lot of new features have been added in Samba 3.2 amongst them:</p>
<ul>
<li>clustered file server support</li>
<li>encrypted network transport</li>
<li>ipv6 support</li>
<li>better integration with the latest version of Microsoft Windows™ clients and servers.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="pam-authentication-framework">PAM authentication framework</h4>
<p>Xubuntu 8.10 features a new pam-auth-update tool, which allows simple management of PAM authentication configuration for both desktops and servers (by Steve Langasek). Packages providing PAM modules will be configured automatically, and users can adjust their authentication preferences by running sudo pam-auth-update.</p>
<p>More information can be found in the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PAMConfigFrameworkSpec">Ubuntu wiki</a>.</p>
<h4 id="totem-bbc-plugin">Totem BBC plugin</h4>
<p>Xubuntu 8.10 features a new plugin for the Totem movie player that fetches free digital content from the BBC. To enable it, start Totem (Applications -&gt; Multimedia -&gt; Movie Player), enable the plugin (Edit -&gt; Plugins -&gt; BBC content viewer) and select &ldquo;BBC&rdquo; from the drop-down labelled &ldquo;Playlist&rdquo;.</p>
