Celebrating 20 Years of Xubuntu
-------------------------------

Xubuntu first joined the Ubuntu family as an official flavor in June 2006. Fast-forward 20 years, and Xubuntu is a fan favorite—fast, lightweight, easy-to-use, and easy-to-recommend. To celebrate both our history and our community, we are hosting two wallpaper contests for Xubuntu 26.04!

As in years past, Xubuntu will celebrate the community with a community wallpaper contest. Six wallpapers will be selected for inclusion on the 26.04 ISO. Winners will receive Xubuntu stickers as a small thank you. See below for contest terms and conditions.

Additionally, we ask the community to vote on past Xubuntu wallpapers to be reimagined for 26.04. We will select two winners: one from each decade, with the team deciding on the default wallpaper. Visit our [Discourse](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/xubuntu-26-04-wallpaper-remix-vote/77214) page to vote by **March 4th**.

How to participate?
-------------------

For a chance to win, submit your submission on the Discourse [contest page](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/xubuntu-26-04-community-wallpaper-contest/77213).

After the submission deadline, the community team will vote on their favorite images and the Xubuntu team will pick 6 winners from all submissions for inclusion on the Xubuntu 26.04 ISO, and will also be available to other Xubuntu version users as a xubuntu-community-wallpaper package. The winners will also receive some Xubuntu stickers.
